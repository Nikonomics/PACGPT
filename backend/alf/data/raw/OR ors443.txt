CARE FACILITIES
443.205

care facilities means facilities providing residential care to adults,
including adult foster homes, group care facilities or residential treatment,
training or care facilities, established, contracted for or operated by the
Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority. [1977 c.779 §3;

1965 c.230 §1; 1973 c.285 §8; repealed by 1977 c.717 §23]
443.215
Policy.
(1) The Legislative Assembly recognizes the importance of providing a high
quality of domiciliary care facilities throughout the State of Oregon.
(2)
It is the intent of ORS 443.205 to 443.225 to distribute domiciliary care
facility capacity on the basis of population and the regional origin of
institutionalized persons. [1977 c.779 §1; formerly 184.875]
443.220
[1953 c.659 §2;
1971 c.650 §21; 1973 c.285 §9; repealed by 1977 c.717 §23]
443.225
Location and capacity of domiciliary care facilities.
(1) Except as
otherwise provided by subsections (3) and (4) of this section, the capacity of
all domiciliary care facilities must be located throughout the state based on
the relationship of the population of the county in which the additional
capacity is proposed to be located to the number of persons originating from
the county who are determined to be in need of domiciliary care. However,
nothing in this subsection is intended to prevent the placement of a person who
is or was not a resident of the county in a domiciliary care facility in the
county.
(2)
The Department of Human Services shall determine the number of persons
originating from a county who are in need of domiciliary care if the
domiciliary care facility is an adult foster home as defined in ORS 443.705, a
residential care facility or residential training facility as those terms are
defined in ORS 443.400 or other group care facility.
(3)
The Oregon Health Authority shall determine the number of persons originating
from a county who are in need of domiciliary care if the domiciliary care
facility is a residential treatment facility as defined in ORS 443.400.
(4)
When a county is too sparsely populated to produce a meaningful ratio of county
population to population in need, or a county is lacking necessary support
services, the population of two or more counties may be combined. The area of
the combined counties may be considered a county for purposes of subsection (1)
of this section.
(5)
The computation required by subsection (1) of this section does not require
reduction in any domiciliary care facility capacity existing on October 4,
1977.
(6)
Subject to the appropriate licensing requirements, the governing body of a
county may authorize a domiciliary care facility located in the county to exceed
the capacity limit imposed by subsection (1) of this section upon:
(a)
Request of an individual or organization operating or proposing to operate a
domiciliary care facility;
(b)
Consultation with an advisory committee appointed by the governing body and
consisting of persons who are particularly interested in the type of
domiciliary care facility contemplated; and
(c)
Finding of good cause following notice and public hearing. [1977 c.779 §2; 1979

Collective bargaining.
(1) As used in this section, adult foster care home
provider means a person who operates an adult foster home in the providers
home and who receives fees or payments from state funds for providing adult
foster care home services. Adult foster care home provider does not include a
person:
(a)
Who is a resident manager of an adult foster home who does not provide adult
foster care home services in the resident managers own home or who does not
have a controlling interest in, or is not an officer or partner in, the entity
that is the provider of adult foster care home services;
(b)
Who is not a natural person; or
(c)
Whose participation in collective bargaining is determined by the licensing
agency to be inconsistent with this section or in violation of state or federal
law.
(2)
For purposes of collective bargaining under ORS 243.650 to 243.809, the State
of Oregon is the public employer of record of adult foster care home providers.
(3)
Notwithstanding ORS 243.650 (19), adult foster care home providers are
considered to be public employees governed by ORS 243.650 to 243.809. Adult
foster care home providers have the right to form, join and participate in the
activities of labor organizations of their own choosing for the purposes of
representation and collective bargaining on matters concerning labor relations.
Mandatory subjects of collective bargaining include but are not limited to
provider base rates and add-on payments. These rights shall be exercised in
accordance with the rights granted to public employees, with mediation and
interest arbitration under ORS 243.742 as the method of concluding the
collective bargaining process. Adult foster care home providers may not strike.
(4)
Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (3) of this section, adult foster care home
providers are not for any other purpose employees of the State of Oregon or any
other public body.
(5)(a)
The Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall represent the State of
Oregon in collective bargaining negotiations with the certified or recognized
exclusive representative of an appropriate bargaining unit of adult foster care
home providers. The Oregon Department of Administrative Services is authorized
to agree to terms and conditions of collective bargaining agreements on behalf
of the State of Oregon.
(b)
The department shall report to the legislative review agency, as defined in ORS
291.371, on any new or changed provisions relating to compensation in a
collective bargaining agreement negotiated under this section.
(6)
Notwithstanding ORS 243.650 (1), an appropriate bargaining unit for adult
foster care home providers is any bargaining unit recognized by the Governor in
an executive order issued prior to January 1, 2008.
(7)
This section does not modify any right of an adult receiving foster care. [2007
c.834 §2; 2009 c.595 §791e; 2009 c.869 §1; 2013 c.722 §32a; 2020 s.s.2 c.10 §8]

member of an adult foster home shall be prohibited from operating, working in
or residing in an adult foster home.
(b)
The licensing agency shall adopt rules that distinguish the criminal
convictions and types of abuse that permanently prohibit a person from
operating, working in or living in an adult foster home from the convictions
and types of abuse that do not permanently prohibit the person from operating,
working in or living in an adult foster home.
(c)
A provider may not hire, retain in employment or allow to live in an adult
foster home, other than as a resident, any person who the provider knows has
been convicted of a disqualifying crime or has been found responsible for a

Educational standards for providers, managers and caregivers; rules; exception;
duties of providers.
(1) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, all providers, resident
managers and substitute caregivers for adult foster homes shall satisfactorily
meet all educational requirements established by the licensing agency. After
consultation with representatives of providers, educators, residents advocates
and the Long Term Care Ombudsman or the Residential Facilities Ombudsman, the
licensing agency shall adopt by rule standards governing the educational
requirements. The rules shall require that a person may not provide care to any
resident prior to acquiring education or supervised training designed to impart
the basic knowledge and skills necessary to maintain the health, safety and
welfare of the resident. Each provider shall document compliance with the
educational requirements for persons subject to the requirements.
(2)
The rules required under subsection (1) of this section shall include but need
not be limited to the following:
(a)
A requirement that, before being licensed, a provider successfully completes
training that satisfies a defined curriculum, including demonstrations and
practice in physical caregiving, screening for care and service needs,
appropriate behavior toward residents with physical, cognitive and mental
disabilities and issues related to architectural accessibility;
(b)
A requirement that a provider pass a test before being licensed or becoming a
resident manager. The test shall evaluate the ability to understand and respond
appropriately to emergency situations, changes in medical conditions,
physicians orders and professional instructions, nutritional needs, residents
preferences and conflicts; and
(c)
A requirement that, after being licensed, a provider or resident manager
successfully completes continuing education as described in ORS 443.742.
(3)
After consultation with representatives of providers, educators, residents
advocates and the Long Term Care Ombudsman or the Residential Facilities
Ombudsman, the licensing agency may adopt by rule exceptions to the training
requirements of subsections (1) and (2) of this section for persons who are
appropriately licensed medical care professionals in Oregon or who possess
sufficient education, training or experience to warrant an exception. The
licensing agency may not make any exceptions to the testing requirements.
(4)
The licensing agency may permit a person who has not completed the training or
passed the test required in subsection (2)(a) and (b) of this section to act as
a resident manager until the training and testing are completed or for 60 days,
whichever is shorter, if the licensing agency determines that an unexpected and
urgent staffing need exists. The licensed provider must notify the licensing
agency of the situation and demonstrate that the provider is unable to find a
qualified resident manager, that the person has met the requirements for a
substitute caregiver for the adult foster home and that the provider will
provide adequate supervision.
(5)
Providers shall serve three nutritionally balanced meals to residents each day.
A menu for the meals for the coming week shall be prepared and posted weekly.
(6)
Providers shall make available at least six hours of activities each week which
are of interest to the residents, not including television or movies. The

property on which the adult foster home is located. Providers shall inform real
estate licensees, prospective buyers, lessees and transferees in all written
communications that the license to operate an adult foster home is not
transferable and shall refer them to the licensing agency for information about
licensing.
(8)
If a resident dies or leaves an adult foster home for medical reasons and
indicates in writing the intent to not return, the provider may not charge the
resident for more than 15 days or the time specified in the provider contract,
whichever is less, after the resident has left the adult foster home. The
provider has an affirmative duty to take reasonable actions to mitigate the
damages by accepting a new resident. However, if a resident dies or leaves an
adult foster home due to neglect or abuse by the provider or due to conditions
of imminent danger to life, health or safety, the provider may not charge the
resident beyond the residents last day in the home. The provider shall refund
any advance payments within 30 days after the resident dies or leaves the adult
foster home.
(9)
Chemical and physical restraints may be used only after considering all other
alternatives and only when required to treat a residents medical symptoms or
to maximize a residents physical functioning. Restraints may not be used for
discipline of a resident or for the convenience of the adult foster home.
Restraints may be used only as follows:
(a)
Psychoactive medications may be used only pursuant to a prescription that
specifies the circumstances, dosage and duration of use.
(b)
Physical restraints may be used only pursuant to a qualified practitioners
order that specifies the type, circumstances and duration of use in accordance
with rules adopted by the licensing agency. The rules adopted by the licensing
agency relating to physical restraints shall include standards for use and training.
(10)
If the physical characteristics of the adult foster home do not encourage
contact between caregivers and residents and among residents, the provider
shall demonstrate how regular positive contact will occur. Providers may not
place residents who are unable to walk without assistance in a basement,
split-level, second story or other area that does not have an exit at ground
level. Nonambulatory residents shall be given first floor rooms.
(11)(a)
The provider may not transfer or discharge a resident from an adult foster home
unless the transfer or discharge is necessary for medical reasons, for the
welfare of the resident or for the welfare of other residents, or due to
nonpayment. In such cases, the provider shall give the resident written notice
as soon as possible under the circumstances.
(b)
The provider shall give the resident and the residents legal representative,
guardian or conservator written notice at least 30 days prior to the proposed
transfer or discharge, except in a medical emergency including but not limited
to a residents experiencing an increase in level of care needs or engaging in
behavior that poses an imminent danger to self or others. In such cases, the
provider shall give the resident written notice as soon as possible under the
circumstances.
(c)
The resident has the right to an administrative hearing prior to an involuntary
transfer or discharge. If the resident is being transferred or discharged for a
medical emergency, or to protect the welfare of the resident or other
residents, as defined by rule, the hearing must be held within seven days of
the transfer or discharge. The provider shall hold a space available for the
resident pending receipt of an administrative order. ORS 441.605 (4) and the
rules thereunder governing transfer notices and hearings for residents of long
term care facilities shall apply to adult foster homes.
(12)
The provider may not include any illegal or unenforceable provision in a
contract with a resident and may not ask or require a resident to waive any of
the residents rights.
(13)
Any lessor of a building in which an adult foster home is located may not
interfere with the admission, discharge or transfer of any resident in the
adult foster home unless the lessor is a provider or coprovider on the license.
