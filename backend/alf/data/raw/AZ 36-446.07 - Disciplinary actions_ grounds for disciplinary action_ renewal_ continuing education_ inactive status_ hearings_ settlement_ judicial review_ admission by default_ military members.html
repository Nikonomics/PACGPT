<p>C. The board may impose a civil penalty in an amount of not to exceed five hundred dollars on any nursing care institution administrator or assisted living facility manager who violates this article or any rule adopted pursuant to this article.  Actions to enforce the collection of these penalties shall be brought in the name of this state by the attorney general or the county attorney in the justice court or the superior court in the county in which the violation occurred.  Penalties imposed under this section are in addition to and not in limitation of other penalties imposed pursuant to this article.</p>

<p>D. The board may file a letter of concern if, in the opinion of the board, while there is insufficient evidence to support direct action against the license of the administrator or the certificate of the manager, there is sufficient evidence for the board to notify the administrator or manager of its concern.</p>

<p>E. Every holder of a nursing care institution administrator's license shall renew it biennially by making application to the board.  The renewals shall be granted as a matter of course if the holder has successfully completed at least fifty hours of continuing education every two years as established by the board in its rules, unless the applicant has acted or failed to act in such a manner or under such circumstances as would constitute grounds for taking any of the disciplinary actions permitted by this section.  The board shall maintain a log of each complaint substantiated by the board or deficiency report concerning an administrator and shall retain in the administrator's file a copy of each such complaint or report and the action taken on it, if any.  The board shall review and consider the administrator's file in determining whether to renew the administrator's license.</p>

<p>F. Except as provided in subsection R of this section,<font color=BLUE> </font>every holder of an assisted living facility manager's certificate shall renew it biennially by making application to the board.  The renewals shall be granted as a matter of course if the holder has successfully completed continuing education every two years as established by the board in its rules, unless the applicant has acted or failed to act in a manner or under circumstances that constitute grounds for taking disciplinary action permitted by this section.  The board shall maintain a log of each complaint substantiated by the board or deficiency report concerning a manager and shall retain in the manager's file a copy of each complaint or report and the action taken on it, if any.  The board shall review and consider the manager's file in determining whether to renew the manager's certificate.</p>

<p>G. Except as provided in subsection R of this section, failure on the part of any licensed nursing care institution administrator or certified assisted living facility manager to furnish evidence of having attended the required continuing education hours during the preceding two years shall preclude renewal of the license or certificate unless the continuing education requirement is fulfilled within one hundred twenty days.</p>

<p>H. On written request to the board, a nursing care institution administrator in good standing may cause the administrator's name and license to be transferred to an inactive list.  Any nursing care institution administrator on inactive license status shall pay a license renewal fee.  On written request to the board, and subsequent approval by the board, a nursing care institution administrator on inactive license status may resume active license status on meeting twenty-five hours of continuing education requirements within six months and payment of the current fee.</p>

<p>I. On written request to the board, the board shall transfer an assisted living facility manager in good standing to an inactive list.  An assisted living facility manager on inactive certificate status shall pay a certificate renewal fee prescribed by the board of not more than one hundred dollars every two years.  On written request to the board, and subsequent approval by the board, an assisted living facility manager on inactive certificate status may resume active certificate status on meeting requirements for six hours of continuing education within six months and payment of the current fee.</p>

<p>J. Suspension, revocation or denial of renewal of a license or certificate or censure or probation of a licensee or certificate holder by the board becomes effective only on the board's first giving the licensee or certificate holder prior written notice and affording the licensee or certificate holder the right to request a hearing within thirty-five days of the receipt of notice.  A hearing is not required before the denial of an original application for a license or a certificate.  All hearings shall be conducted pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10.</p>

<p>K. Any person wishing to make a complaint against a licensee or certificate holder under this article shall file a written complaint with the board within one year from the date of the action causing the complaint.  If the board determines that the charges made in the complaint are sufficient, if true, to warrant suspension or revocation of a license or certificate issued under this article or censure or probation of a licensee or certificate holder under this article, it shall issue an order fixing the time and place for a hearing and requiring the licensee or certificate holder complained against to appear and answer the complaint.  The order shall have affixed to it a copy of the complaint, and both shall be served on the licensee or certificate holder either personally or by certified mail sent to the licensee's or the certificate holder's last known address at least thirty-five days before the date set for the hearing.  All hearings shall be conducted pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10.</p>

<p>L. The board and an administrator or manager may enter into a settlement of any matter under investigation either before or after a notice of the hearing has been issued if the board determines that the proposed settlement adequately protects the public safety, health and welfare. The board shall record the terms of each settlement entered into and shall make the record available for public inspection.</p>

<p>M. Except as provided in section 41-1092.08, subsection H, final decisions of the board are subject to judicial review pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6.</p>

<p>N. If the board has initiated an investigation pursuant to this section, the board may continue the investigation and discipline the person under investigation even if that person resigns from practice after the board has initiated the investigation.</p>

<p>O. A licensee or certificate holder shall respond in writing to the board within thirty-five days after the board serves the complaint and notice of a formal hearing by certified mail.  Service is complete on the date the board places the notice in the mail.  The board shall consider a licensee's or certificate holder's failure to respond to the notice within thirty-five days as an admission by default to the allegations stated in the complaint.  The board may then take disciplinary action against the licensee or certificate holder without conducting a formal hearing.</p>

<p>P. The board may set aside an admission by default if a licensee or certificate holder shows good cause. A licensee or certificate holder who applies to the board to set aside an admission by default shall demonstrate the following to the satisfaction of the board: </p>

<p>1. The failure to respond to the notice of the board was due to excusable neglect.</p>

<p>2. The licensee or certificate holder has a meritorious defense.</p>

<p>3. The licensee or certificate holder made prompt application to the board for relief.</p>

<p>Q. The board shall not consider an application to set aside an admission by default filed later than one hundred eighty days after the board's entry of the admission by default.</p>

<p>R. A license or certificate issued pursuant to this chapter to any member of the Arizona national guard or the United States armed forces reserves shall not expire while the member is serving on federal active duty and shall be extended one hundred eighty days after the member returns from federal active duty, provided that the member, or the legal representative of the member, notifies the board of the federal active duty status of the member.  A license or certificate issued pursuant to this chapter to any member serving in the regular component of the United States armed forces shall be extended one hundred eighty days from the date of expiration, provided that the member, or the legal representative of the member, notifies the board of the federal active duty status of the member.  If the license or certificate is renewed during the applicable extended time period, the member is responsible only for normal fees and activities relating to renewal of the license and shall not be charged any additional costs such as late fees or delinquency fees.  The member, or the legal representative of the member, shall present to the board a copy of the member's official military orders, a redacted military identification card or a written verification from the member's commanding officer before the end of the applicable extended time period in order to qualify for the extension.</p>

<p>S. A license or certificate issued pursuant to this chapter to any member of the Arizona national guard, the United States armed forces reserves or the regular component of the United States armed forces shall not expire and shall be extended one hundred eighty days from the date the military member is able to perform activities necessary under the license or certificate if the member both:</p>

<p>1. Is released from active duty service.</p>

<p>2. Suffers an injury as a result of active duty service that temporarily prevents the member from being able to perform activities necessary under the license, certificate or registration. </p>
