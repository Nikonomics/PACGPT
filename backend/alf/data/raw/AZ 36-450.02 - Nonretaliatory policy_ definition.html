<p>B. A third-party contractor of a health care institution may not take retaliatory action as proscribed in this section.</p>

<p>C. This section does not prohibit a health care institution that is licensed pursuant to this chapter from taking action against a health professional for a purpose that is not related to a report filed pursuant to section 36-450.01. </p>

<p>D. Except as provided in section 23-1501, subsection A, paragraph 3, subdivisions (a) and (c), this section shall be enforced only through the provisions of this chapter. </p>
