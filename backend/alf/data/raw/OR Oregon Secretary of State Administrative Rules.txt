Division 57
ENDORSED MEMORY CARE COMMUNITIES
411-057-0100
Statement of Purpose
The purpose of the rules in OAR chapter 411, division 057 is to establish standards for the endorsement of memory care communities. Memory care communities provide specialized services in a secured environment for individuals with dementia. These rules are designed to ensure that residents living in memory care communities have positive quality of life, consumer protection, and person directed care. Resident’s rights, dignity, choice, comfort, and independence are promoted in this setting. The endorsement does not constitute a recommendation of any endorsed memory care community by the Department of Human Services, Aging and People with Disabilities Program.
