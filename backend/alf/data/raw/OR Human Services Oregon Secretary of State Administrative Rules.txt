Purpose and Scope
(1)
The purpose of these rules, OAR 407-007-
0000
to 407-007-0100 is to supplement OAR 125-007-0200 to 125-007-0330 with guidelines and requirements specific to background checks for Oregon Department of Human Services (Department or ODHS) and Oregon Health Authority (Authority or OHA) subject individuals (SIs). These rules provide for the reasonable screening under ORS 181A.195
,
181A.200
, 409.027 AND 413.036
of the Department’s employees, volunteers, and contractors to determine if they have a history of
specific
criminal behavior
identified in federal or state law or rules
such that they should not be allowed to work, volunteer, be employed, or otherwise perform in positions covered by these rules.
(2)
These rules apply to evaluating potentially disqualifying
convictions and conditions of an SI when conducting fitness determinations based upon such information. The fact that an SI is approved does not guarantee employment or placement. Except for OAR 407-007-0010, these rules do not apply to SIs covered under OAR 407-007-0200 to 407-007-0370.
(3)
The Authority authorizes the Background Check Unit (BCU), a shared service of the Department and the Authority, to act on its behalf in performing criminal records checks. References in these rules to the Department or Authority are references to either or both agencies.
(4) When the position the SI is having a criminal records check for also requires an abuse check under OAR 407-007-0400 to 407-007-0460
, the result of the criminal records check and abuse check will be completed as one final fitness determination or outcome
.

potentially disqualifying
criminal behavior by an SI that could more likely than not pose an immediate risk to the Department, its clients, or vulnerable persons, the Department may authorize a criminal records check without the completion of a criminal records check request.
(b)
If the Department determines that a fitness determination based on the criminal records check would be adverse to the SI, the Department must provide the SI, if available, the opportunity to disclose potentially disqualifying
convictions and
conditions, and other information as indicated in OAR 407-007-0060 before the completion of the fitness determination.

In a background check request, an SI has submitted the answer, “No” to the question regarding whether the SI has criminal history
;
(b)
The Department finds potentially disqualifying criminal history in the criminal records check; and
(c)
The found potentially disqualifying criminal history occurred before the date of the SI’s submission
.
(2)
The SI is a registered sex offender in any jurisdiction. There is a rebuttable presumption that an SI is likely to engage in conduct that would pose a significant risk to the Department, its clients, or vulnerable individuals if the SI has been designated a predatory sex offender under ORS 181.585 or found to be a sexually violent dangerous offender under ORS 144.635 (or similar statutes in other jurisdictions).
(3)
The SI has an outstanding warrant
for any permanent review crime
in any jurisdiction.
(4)
The SI has a deferred sentence, conditional discharge, or is participating in a diversion program
for a permanent review crime
in any jurisdiction
.
(5)
The SI is currently on probation, parole, or post-prison supervision for
a potentially disqualifying
crime in any jurisdiction
.
(6)
The SI is found in violation of post-prison supervision, parole, or probation for
a potentially disqualifying crime or condition
in any jurisdiction regardless of the original conviction date within five years from the
date of the final fitness determination
.
(7)
The SI has an unresolved arrest, charge, or a pending indictment for any
permanent review crime
.
(8)
The SI has been arrested
for a permanent review crime
in any jurisdiction as a fugitive from another state or a fugitive from justice
for a permanent review crime that results in a potentially disqualifying conviction or condition.
(9)
An adjudication in a juvenile court in any jurisdiction, finding that the SI was responsible for a
permanent review crime
that would result in a conviction if committed by an adult. Subsequent adverse rulings from a juvenile court, such as probation violations, are also potentially disqualifying if occurring within five years from the date of the
final fitness determination
.
(10)
A finding of “guilty except for insanity,” “guilty except by reason of insanity,” “not guilty by reason of insanity,” “responsible except for insanity,” “not responsible by reason of mental disease or defect,” or similarly worded disposition in any jurisdiction regarding a
permanent review crime
, unless the local statutes indicate that such an outcome is considered an acquittal.

Weighing Test
If the SI has potentially disqualifying convictions under
OAR 407-007-0
0
41,
or potentially disqualifying conditions under OAR 407-007-0050,
the Department conducts a weighing test.
If the SI is subject to an abuse check in accordance with OAR 407-007-0400 to 407-007-0460 and has potentially disqualifying abuse, the weighing test includes the consideration of factors in this rule and in OAR 407-007-0430.
The weighing test includes consideration of factors pursuant to ORS 181A.195 and the following if available at the time of the weighing test:
(1)
Circumstances regarding the nature of potentially disqualifying crimes and conditions including but not limited to:

Age
, maturity and capacity
of the SI at time of the potentially disqualifying
conviction
or condition.

(A) Effective February 1, 2021, most possession crimes in Oregon were reduced to violations, making them no longer potentially disqualifying.
(B) The Department may give less weight to a potentially disqualifying conviction or condition which is only potentially disqualifying because it was a crime at the time it occurred but at the time of the weighing test is no longer considered a crime nor is associated with any potentially disqualifying conviction or condition.
(C) The consideration given potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions impacted by federal laws, regulations, or rules is determined by the number of these potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions and evaluation of relevant factors in sections (1), (2) and (3).
(2) Other factors when available including but not limited to:
(a)
Periods of incarceration
, including rehabilitation or other impacts on SI
.

The Department may not hire an SI on a preliminary basis prior to the completion of a preliminary fitness determination.
(2)
After review of the criminal records check request, the Department makes one of the following determinations:

An SI may be hired on a preliminary basis, only during the time period prior to a final fitness determination, into the position listed in the criminal records check request and allowed to participate in training, orientation, and position activities under the one of the following circumstances:
(A)
If there is no indication of potentially disqualifying
convictions
or conditions in the criminal records check request and the Department has no reason to believe the SI has potentially disqualifying
convictions
or conditions.
(B)
If an SI discloses potentially disqualifying
convictions
or conditions, the SI may be hired on a preliminary basis only after BCU
completes a weighing test. The Department may hire an SI on a preliminary basis only if, based on information available at the time, BCU
determines that more likely than not that the SI poses no potential threat to the Department, its clients, or vulnerable persons.
(b)
The Department may not hire an SI on a preliminary basis if the BCU
or Human Resources
determines that:
(A)
After a weighing test, the SI more likely than not poses a potential threat to the Department, its clients, or vulnerable persons;
(B)
The SI’s most recent criminal records check under these rules or other Department criminal records check rules resulted in a denial; or
(C)
The SI is currently involved in contesting a criminal records check determination under
these
or other Department criminal records check or abuse check rules.

(b)
Know where the SI is and what the SI is doing; and
(c)
Periodically observe the actions of the SI.
(4)
An SI who was approved without restrictions within the previous 24 months through a documented criminal records check pursuant to these rules may work after being hired on a preliminary basis without active supervision. The

(a)
There is any indication of falsification in the
criminal records check
request.

preliminary fitness determination by the Department,
or regulations regarding the position.
(6)

Purpose and Scope
(1) The purpose of these rules, OAR 407-007-0200 to 407-007-0370, is to supplement OAR 125-007-0200 to 125-007-0330 with guidelines and requirements specific to background checks for Oregon Department of Human Services (Department or ODHS) and Oregon Health Authority (Authority) subject individuals (SIs). These rules provide for the reasonable screening under ORS 181A.195, 181A.200, 409.027, and 413.036 of SIs to determine if they have a history of specific criminal or abusive behavior
identified in federal or state law or rules
such that they should not be allowed to work, volunteer, be employed, reside, or otherwise perform in positions covered by these rules.
(2) These rules apply to evaluating potentially disqualifying convictions and conditions of an SI when conducting fitness determinations based upon such information. The fact that an SI is approved does not guarantee employment or placement. These rules do not apply to individuals subject to OAR 407-007-0000 to 407-007-0100 (ODHS Employees, Volunteers, and Contractors) or 407-007-0400 to 407-007-0460 (Abuse Check Rules for Department Employees and Volunteers).
(3) Providers for the Department and the Authority are subject to criminal records and abuse checks. The Authority authorizes the Department to act on its behalf in carrying out criminal and abuse checks associated with programs or activities administered by the Authority. References in these rules to the Department or Authority shall be construed to be references to either or both agencies.

Background Check Required
(1) An SI must have a background check in the following circumstances:
(a) An individual who becomes an SI on or after the effective date of these rules.
(b) The SI changes employers to a different QE.
(c) The individual, whether previously considered an SI or not, changes positions under the same QE, and the new position requires a background check.
(d) The individual, whether previously considered an SI or not, changes Department or Authority-issued licenses, certifications, or registrations, and the license, certification, or registration requires a background check under these rules.
(e) For a student enrolled in a nursing facility nursing assistant training program for employment at the facility, a new background check is required when the student is first enrolled in the training program to be in contact with nursing facility patients, and again if the student becomes an employee at the facility unless the first background check results in good standing in the background check registry and portability pursuant to OAR 407-007-0600 to 407-007-0640.
(f) A background check is required by federal or state laws or regulations, other Department or Authority administrative rules, or by contract with the Department or Authority.
(g) When BCU or the QE has reason to believe that a background check is justified, if allowed by statute or rule. Examples include but are not limited to:
(A) Credible evidence of new potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions. Pursuant to OAR 407-007-0620(6), BCU must either immediately remove an SI's portability, revoke an SI's good standing, or both if BCU receives credible evidence indicating that the SI has new potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions.
(B) A lapse in working or volunteering in a position under the direction and control of the QE but the SI is still considered in the position. For example, an extended period of leave by an SI. The QE determines the need for a background check.
(C) Quality assurance monitoring by the Department or Authority of a previously conducted criminal records check or abuse check.
(2) If the SI is subject to a background check due to involvement with the foster or adoptive placement of a child and:
(a) Is subject to the Interstate Compact on Placement of Children (ORS 417.200 and OAR 413-040-0200 to 413-040-0330), the background check must comply with Interstate Compact requirements.
(b) Is subject to the Inter-County Adoption Act of 2000 (42 USC 14901 et seq.), the background check must comply with federal requirements and ORS 417.262.
(3) If QEs, Department program rules, or Authority program rules require an SI to report any new arrests, charges, or convictions, the QE may determine if personnel action is required if the SI does not report. Personnel action may include a new background check if allowed by statute or rule.
(4) A homecare worker or personal support worker, as defined in ORS 410.600, is subject to section (1) of this rules.  However, a homecare worker or personal support worker does not need a new background check when adding new client employers by meeting the following requirements: the homecare worker or personal support worker must have:
(a) A Department background check notice of final fitness determination dated within the recheck period according to Department program rules showing that the homecare worker or personal support worker has been:
(A) Approved;
(B) Approved with restrictions that do not prohibit additional clients; or
(C) Approved but not having portability pursuant to OAR 407-007-0600 to 407-007-0640; and
(b) The background check notice of final fitness determination lists a worksite of “various,” “various clients,” “statewide,” or similar wording.
(5) A personal care services provider, lifespan respite or other respite care provider, or an independent provider paid with Department or Authority funds is subject to section (1) of this rule.  However, an SI in these positions may change or add clients within the same QE, Department, or Authority district without a new background check if the prior, documented criminal records check or abuse check conducted within the previous 24 months through the Department or Authority has been:
(a) Approved;
(b) Approved with restrictions that do not prohibit additional clients; or
(c) Approved but not having portability pursuant to OAR 407-007-0600 to 407-007-0640.
(6)
Regardless of section (1) of this rules, an individual subject to ORS 475A and OAR 333-333-4100 follows the criminal records check requirements in ORS chapter 475A and OAR 333-333-4100.
(7) If an SI remains with a QE in the same position listed in the background check request and the QE merges with another QE, is sold to another QE, or changes names, the SI does not need a new background check. The changes to the QE may be noted in documentation attached to the notice of fitness determination but do not warrant a new background check.
(8) For a student enrolled in a nursing facility nursing assistant training program for employment at the facility, a new background check is not required at graduation from the training program or at the granting of certification by the Board of Nursing.
(9) The SI on the background check registry in good standing maintained under OAR 407-007-0600 to 407-007-0640 is subject to section (1) of this rule when the SI’s new background check being considered is not for a position that would result in placement on the background check registry maintained under OAR 407-007-0600 to 407-007-0640 if approved.
(10)
The restrictions on criminal records checks in this section may exempt an SI from background checks required under section (1) of this rule as determined by the Department pursuant to ORS 443.004(1)(b).
(a) This section applies to an SI subject to ORS 443.004 who is:
(A) An employee of a residential facility or an adult foster home;
(B) Any individual who is paid directly or indirectly with public funds who has or will have contact with a recipient of support services or a resident of an adult foster home or a residential facility; and
(C) A home care worker or a personal support worker as defined in ORS 410.600.
(b) The Department must complete not more than one criminal records check every 18 months on an SI subject to this section, effective as of the completion of the SI’s first background check after the implementation of ORS 443.004(1)(b) (Or Law 2021 chapter 198), on June 8, 2021.
(c) A criminal records check, as part of a new background check, may be completed more often only if the Department:
(A) Receives credible evidence of a new criminal conviction;
(B) Receives credible evidence of potentially disqualifying abuse
;
(C) Is required by federal law to conduct more frequent criminal record checks;
(D) Is notified by a QE and an SI has changed position or duties for which there are different criminal records check requirements; or
(E) Determines that it would be burdensome for an SI to wait for a new criminal records check, including but not limited to:
(i) The Department receives credible evidence of a change in circumstances that could positively impact a previous fitness determination;
(ii) The SI is seeking certification, licensure, or some other qualification associated with his or her job that requires a background check;
(d) If the Department determines that a new fitness determination is necessary and a new criminal records check is not allowed, the Department may complete a new abuse check and use information from the most recent criminal records check completed on the SI in the Department’s records.  An example of when a new fitness determination is necessary, and a new criminal records check is not allowed, is when BCU learns of a new potentially disqualifying condition.
(e) If an SI changes positions while staying with the same QE and the new position is not subject to the registry under OAR 407-007-0600 to 407-007-0640, the QED must document that no new background check may be completed for the new position pursuant to ORS 443.004 and OAR 407-007-0220(10)(b).
(f) If the SI is applying for a position that requires a background check under these rules but is not subject to ORS 443.004, the restrictions in this section do not apply and do not count as criminal records checks towards this section.
(11) Background checks are completed on SIs who otherwise meet the qualifications of the position listed on the background check request, the position description completed by the QE, and the program rules governing the QE and position. A background check may not be used to screen applicants for a position or who do not meet such qualifications.

(B) Any direct care staff secured by any residential care or assisted living facility through the services of a personnel services or staffing agency and the direct care staff works in the facility.
(C) A homecare worker as defined in ORS 410.600, a personal support worker as defined in ORS 410.600, a personal care services provider, or an independent provider employed by a Department client who provides care to the client if the Department helps pay for the services.
(D) An employee providing care to the Department’s APD program clients who works for an in-home care agency as defined by ORS 443.305 which has enrolled to deliver Medicaid funded services as described in OAR 411-033-0000 to 411-033 to 0030 for Department clients.
(E) An individual in a position specified as being subject in relevant Oregon statutes or Oregon administrative rules.
(2) If BCU determines that an individual subject to this rule has a conviction listed in ORS 443.004, BCU must all make the determination of ineligible due to ORS 443.004. Under OAR 125-007-0260, this determination is considered an incomplete fitness determination. A fitness determination with a weighing test is not required regardless of any other potentially disqualifying convictions and conditions the SI has. BCU must provide notice of ineligibility due to ORS 443.004 to the individual.
(3) An individual subject to this rule who is an employee and hired prior to July 28, 2009 is exempt from section (2) of this rule provided that the employee remains working for the same employer after July 28, 2009.  The SI may transfer or promote to other positions with this same employer and remain exempt from section (2) of this rule.

(c) If the SI works at a QE facility or agency that has a parent company or corporation, the SI may work at any QE facility or agency under the parent company or corporation.
(d) For all other SIs, the employer is a QE.
(4) If an individual subject to this rule is grandfathered under section (3) of this rule or is not found ineligible due to ORS 443.004, the individual is subject to a fitness determination under OAR 125-007-0260 and 407-007-0320 for any other potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions in OAR 407-007-0281 and 407-007-0290. The original one or more convictions that led to grandfathering could be used as potentially disqualifying and in a weighing test only if there was a repetition of behavior shown in criminal history subsequent to the grandfathering convictions.
(5) A determination of ineligible due to ORS 443.004 is not subject to appeal rights under OAR 125-007-0300, 407-007-0330, or 943-007-0501.

Potentially Disqualifying Conditions
Pursuant to OAR 125-007-0270, the following are potentially disqualifying conditions, if they exist on the date of the final fitness determination unless otherwise noted.
This rule does not apply to SIs subject to ORS 475A and OAR 333-333-4100.
(1) False statement is potentially disqualifying when all the following conditions are met:
(a) In a background check request, an SI has submitted the answer, “No” to the question regarding whether the SI has criminal history;
(b) The Department finds potentially disqualifying criminal history in the criminal records check; and
(c) The found potentially disqualifying criminal history occurred before the date of the SI’s submission of the criminal records check request.
(2) The SI is a registered sex offender in any jurisdiction. There is a rebuttable presumption that an SI is likely to engage in conduct that would pose a significant risk to vulnerable individuals if the SI has been designated as a level three sex offender under ORS 163A.100(3), a predatory sex offender prior to January 1, 2014, or found to be a sexually violent dangerous offender under ORS 144.635 (or similar designations in other jurisdictions).
(3) The SI has an outstanding warrant for any permanent review crime in any jurisdiction.
(4) The SI has a deferred sentence, conditional discharge, or is participating in a diversion program for a permanent review crime in any jurisdiction.
(5) The SI is currently on probation, parole, or post-prison supervision for a potentially disqualifying crime in any jurisdiction.
(6) The SI has been found in violation of post-prison supervision, parole, or probation for a potentially disqualifying crime or condition in any jurisdiction within five years from the date of the final fitness determination.
(7) The SI has an unresolved arrest, charge, or a pending indictment for a permanent review crime in any jurisdiction.
(8) The SI has been arrested in any jurisdiction as a fugitive from another state or a fugitive from justice for a permanent review crime that results in a potentially disqualifying conviction or condition.
(9) The SI has an adjudication in a juvenile court in any jurisdiction, finding that the SI was responsible for a permanent review crime that would result in a conviction if committed by an adult. Subsequent adverse rulings from a juvenile court, such as probation violations, are also  potentially disqualifying if within five years from the date of the final fitness determination.
(10) The SI has a finding of “guilty except for insanity,” “guilty except by reason of insanity,” “not guilty by reason of insanity,” “responsible except for insanity,” “not responsible by reason of mental disease or defect,” or similarly worded disposition in any jurisdiction regarding a permanent review crime, unless the local statutes indicate that such an outcome is considered an acquittal.
(11) The SI has potentially disqualifying abuse as determined from abuse investigation reports which have an outcome of founded or substantiated, and in which the SI is determined to have been responsible for the abuse. For the following SIs, potentially disqualifying abuse includes:
(a) For an SI subject to 42 USC 671(a)(20) under the State Plan for Foster Care and Adoption Assistance (the Adam Walsh Act of 2006) or who is an employee of a QE subject to Section 471(a)(20)(D) of the federal 2018 Family First Prevention Services Act
and which receives title IV-E funds
:
(A) Child protective services history held or received by the Department or OTIS regardless of the date of the initial report;
(B) Child protective services history from any state or jurisdiction reviewed pursuant to the federal requirements and determined by BCU to be potentially disqualifying; and
(C) Adult protective services investigations of neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse, or financial exploitation initiated on or after January 1, 2010, as provided to BCU by OTIS and APD programs based on severity.
(b) For an SI on the background check registry maintained under OAR 407-007-0600 to 407-007-0640; licensed, certified, or otherwise regulated by the Department; associated with any QE licensed, certified, or otherwise regulated by the Department (any QE licensed, certified, or regulated only with the Authority and not the Department are not included):
(A) Child protective services history held or received by the Department or OTIS regardless of the date of the initial report; and
(B) Adult protective services investigations of neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse, or financial exploitation initiated on or after January 1, 2010, as provided to BCU by the OTIS and APD programs based on severity.
(c) For any other SI with direct contact with children:
(A) Child protective services history held or received by the Department or OTIS regardless of the date of the initial report; and
(B) Adult protective services investigations of neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse, or financial exploitation initiated on or after January 1, 2010, as provided to BCU by the OTIS and APD programs based on severity.
(d) For all other SIs, adult protective services investigations of neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse, or financial exploitation initiated on or after January 1, 2010, as provided to the BCU by OTIS and APD programs based on severity.
(12) For an SI who is a proctor foster parent, the SI has any restraining order or protective order against the SI.
(13) For an SI who is SI who is a proctor foster parent, the SI makes a false statement to the QE or Department, including the provision of materially false information, regarding abuse, restraining orders, or protective orders; or failure to disclose information regarding abuse, restraining orders, or protective orders. Nondisclosure of unsubstantiated or inconclusive abuse or dismissed restraining orders or protective orders, may not be considered a false statement.

Weighing Test
If an SI has potentially disqualifying convictions under OAR 407-007-0281, or potentially disqualifying conditions under OAR 407-007-0290, BCU conducts a weighing test. The weighing test includes consideration of factors pursuant to ORS 181A.195 and the following if available to the BCU at the time of the weighing test.
(1) Circumstances regarding the nature of potentially disqualifying convictions and conditions including but not limited to:
(a) The details of incidents leading to the potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions.
(b) Age, maturity and mental capacity of the SI at time of the potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions.
(c) Facts that support the potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions.
(d) Passage of time since commission of the potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions.
(e) Consideration of state or federal laws, regulations, or rules covering the position, facility, employer, or QE regarding the potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions.
(f) Consideration of state or federal laws, regulations, or rules that impact what is considered potentially disqualifying.  For example:
(A) Effective February 1, 2021, most possession crimes in Oregon were reduced to violations, making them no longer potentially disqualifying.
(B) The Department may give less weight to a potentially disqualifying conviction or condition which is only potentially disqualifying because it was a crime at the time it occurred but at the time of the weighing test is no longer considered a crime nor is associated with any potentially disqualifying conviction or condition.
(C) The consideration given potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions impacted by federal laws, regulations, or rules is determined by the number of these potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions and evaluation of relevant factors in sections (1), (2) and (3) of this rule.
(2) If applicable, circumstances regarding the nature of potentially disqualifying abuse including but not limited to:
(a) The nature and type of abuse; and
(b) Other information gathered during the scope of the abuse investigation.
(c) The date of the abuse incident and abuse investigation.
(d) The quality of the abuse investigation including, if applicable, any exhibits and related documents with consideration taken into account regarding completeness, objectivity, and sufficiency.
(e) Due process or lack thereof provided to the SI after the abuse investigation.
(f) Required conditions and actions resulting from the founded or substantiated abuse that would allow for reinstatement of the SI in the position including but not limited to training, counseling, corrective or disciplinary action, and the SI’s compliance.
(3) Other factors when available including but not limited to:
(a) Periods of incarceration, including rehabilitation or other impacts on SI.
(b) Status of and compliance with parole, post-prison supervision, or probation regarding potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions.
(c) Evidence of alcohol or drug issues directly related to potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions.
(d) Evidence of other treatment or rehabilitation related to potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions.
(e) Likelihood of repetition of behaviors leading to potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions.
(f) Other information related to criminal activity including charges, arrests, pending indictments, and convictions. Other behavior involving contact with law enforcement may also be reviewed if information is relevant to other criminal records or shows a pattern relevant to criminal history. Consideration of these activities and behaviors are only allowed for SIs listed in OAR 407-007-0281(1).
(g)
Changes in circumstances subsequent to the potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions including but not limited to:
(A) History of high school, college, or other education related accomplishments.
(B) Work history (employee or volunteer).
(C) History regarding licensure, certification, or training for licensure or certification.
(D) Written recommendations from current or past employers, including Department client employers.
(h) Indication of the SI’s cooperation, honesty during the background check process, including:
(A) Acknowledgment and acceptance of responsibility of potentially disqualifying convictions and conditions; or
(B) Providing false, incomplete or misleading information regarding potentially disqualifying convictions and conditions, or any subsequent circumstances.
(4) BCU must consider the relevancy of the SI’s potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions to the paid or volunteer position, or to the environment in which the SI will reside, work, or visit.

Hired on a Preliminary Basis
(1) A preliminary fitness determination is required to determine if an SI may participate in training or orientation, work, volunteer, or otherwise perform in the position listed on the background check request prior to a final fitness determination. An SI may not be hired on a preliminary basis prior to the completion of a preliminary fitness determination.
(2) An SI may be hired on a preliminary basis only:
(a) During the period of time prior to a final fitness determination;
(b) For the position listed on the background check request; and
(c) If not prohibited by section (4) of this rule.
(3) To be hired on a preliminary basis, an SI and QED must provide minimum information required for a background check request as indicated in OAR 407-007-0250.
(4) The QE may not hire a SI on a preliminary basis under any of the following circumstances:
(a)
Program rules, Oregon statutes, or federal directives do not allow hiring on a preliminary basis
.
(b) Once submitted in ORCHARDS, the background check record indicates that preliminary hire is not allowed and the QE does not subsequently request a review by BCU as indicated in section (5) of this rule resulting in the QE being allowed to hire the SI on a preliminary basis.
(c) The QE or BCU determines that:
(A) More likely than not, the SI poses a potential threat to vulnerable individuals, based on a preliminary fitness determination and weighing test;
(B) The SI’s most recent background check under these rules or other Department or Authority criminal records check rules or abuse check rules resulted in a denial; or
(C) The SI is currently involved in contesting a background check under these or other Department or Authority criminal records check rules or abuse check rules; or
(D) BCU has reason to believe hiring on a preliminary basis is not appropriate based on circumstances or compliance with the background check process of the SI, QED, or QE.
(d) An outcome of not hiring on a preliminary basis may only be overturned by the BCU.
(5) If requested by the QED, BCU may review a newly submitted background check request when hiring on a preliminary basis has not been allowed.  For example:
(a) BCU may review the background check request for disclosed criminal history that caused BCU’s background check online system to not allow hiring on a preliminary basis. If BCU does not find any potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions in the SI’s disclosures, BCU updates the SI’s status accordingly.  The QE may hire the SI on a preliminary basis if nothing in section (4) of this rule applies.
(b) If the SI has disclosed potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions, BCU may conduct a preliminary fitness determination pursuant to OAR 125-007-0250 with a weighing test.  If BCU makes a positive decision in the preliminary fitness determination, BCU updates the SI’s status accordingly and the QE may hire the SI on a preliminary basis if nothing in section (4) of this rule applies. If BCU makes a negative decision, BCU must revoke hiring of the SI on a preliminary basis.
(6) An SI hired on a preliminary basis must be actively supervised at all times unless sections (7) or (8) of this rule apply.
(a) The individual providing active supervision at all times must do the following:
(A) Be in the same building as the SI or, if outdoors of QE buildings or any location off the QE property, be within line-of-sight and -of-hearing, except as provided in section (6)(b)(B) of this rule;
(B) Know where the SI is and what the SI is doing; and
(C) Periodically observe the actions of the SI.
(b) The individual providing the active supervision may be either:
(A) An SI who has been approved without restrictions pursuant to these rules or previous Department or Authority criminal records check rules; or
(B) The adult client, an adult client’s adult relation, the client’s legal representative, or a child’s parent or guardian. Active supervision by these individuals is appropriate in situations where care is given directly to clients usually in a home such as but not limited to in-home care, home health, or care by home care workers, or personal care assistants.
(i) The adult client may actively supervise a homecare worker, personal care services provider, independent provider, or an employee of an in-home care agency or home health agency if the client makes an informed decision to employ the provider. Someone related to the client may also provide active supervision if the relative has been approved by the Department, the Authority, the QED, or the private-pay client receiving services through an in-home care or home health agency.
(ii)  A child client’s parent or guardian is responsible for providing active supervision in the case of child care providers. The supervision is not required to be performed by someone in the same building as the child.
(7) An SI allowed to work on a preliminary basis is exempt from active supervision if SI is working under an approved background check and is currently going through a recheck required by program rules or OAR 407-007-0600 to 407-007-0640 unless there is evidence of potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions since the previous background check.  If BCU finds evidence of criminal activity or potentially disqualifying abuse since the previous background check, BCU may revoke working on a preliminary basis.
(8) An SI approved without restrictions within the previous 24 months through a documented criminal records check or abuse check pursuant to these rules or prior Department or Authority criminal records check rules or abuse check rules may be hired on a preliminary basis without active supervision. Twenty-four months is calculated from date of previous approval to the date of hire in the new position. Exemption from active supervision is not allowed in any of the following situations:
(a) If the SI cannot provide documented proof that he or she worked continuously under the previous approval for at least one year.
(b) If there is evidence of potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions within the previous 24 months.
(c) If, as determined by the QE or BCU, the job duties in the new position are so substantially different from the previous position that the previous fitness determination is inadequate for the current position.
(9) Revocation of hired on a preliminary basis is not subject to hearing or appeal. The QE or BCU may immediately revoke hired on a preliminary basis for either of the following reasons:
(a) There is any indication of falsification of the background check application.
(b) The QE or BCU determines that allowing the SI to be hired on a preliminary basis is not appropriate, based on the application, criminal record, position duties, preliminary fitness determination by the Department, or Department program rules.
(10) Nothing in this rule is intended to require that an SI who is eligible to be hired on a preliminary basis be allowed to work, volunteer, be employed, or otherwise perform in the position listed on the background check request prior to a final fitness determination.
(11) Preliminary fitness determinations must be documented in writing, including any details regarding a weighing test, if required.

(A) The SI has no potentially disqualifying convictions or potentially disqualifying conditions; or
(B) The SI has potentially disqualifying convictions or potentially disqualifying conditions and, after a weighing test, the authorized designee determines that more likely than not, the SI poses no risk to the physical, emotional, or financial well-being of vulnerable individuals.
(b) The authorized designee may approve an SI with restrictions if the SI has potentially disqualifying convictions or potentially disqualifying conditions and, after a weighing test, the authorized designee determines that more likely than not the SI poses no risk to the physical, emotional, or financial well-being of vulnerable individuals if certain restrictions are placed on the SI. Restrictions may include but are not limited to restrictions to one or more specific clients, job duties, or environments. A new background check and fitness determination shall be completed on the SI before removing a restriction.
(c) The authorized designee shall deny an SI if the SI has potentially disqualifying convictions or potentially disqualifying conditions and, after a weighing test, the authorized designee determines more likely than not the SI poses a risk to the physical, emotional, or financial well-being of vulnerable individuals.
(d) In the following situations the SI shall have no hearing rights and the authorized designee shall consider a background check to have an outcome of incomplete fitness determination:
(A) The QE or SI discontinues the application or fails to cooperate with the background check or fitness determination process, including but not limited to failure to disclose all requested criminal, abuse or other information, refusal to be fingerprinted or failing to respond in a timely manner to written correspondence from BCU. The background check request is considered closed.
(B) BCU determines that the SI is ineligible due to ORS 443.004 in accordance with OAR 407-007-0275 or 407-007-0277. The background check request is considered completed.
(C) BCU or the QE withdraws or closes the background check request before a final fitness determination for any reason. The background check request is considered closed.
(D) The SI withdraws the application, leaves the position prior to completion of the background check, or the Department cannot locate or contact the SI. The background check request is considered closed.
(E) The QE determines that the SI ineligible for the position for reasons other than the background check. The background check request is considered closed.
(F) The SI who is a proctor foster parent and fails to provide a release of information, the background check request is considered closed.
(G) The authorized designee determines that the final fitness determination is Mandatory exclusion due to the SI being subject to OAR 407-007-0279 and having a conviction or condition listed in OAR 407-007-0279. The background check request is considered completed.
(3) Upon completion of a final fitness determination, BCU or the QE shall provide notice to the SI.
(a) If approved, BCU shall provide notice to the QE through ORCHARDS. The QE shall provide the SI a copy of the notice or ORCHARDS documentation.
(b) If denied or approved with restrictions, BCU shall issue a notice of fitness determination to the SI which includes the potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions that the outcome was based upon, information regarding appeal rights, and the notice becoming a final order in the event of a withdrawal or failure to appear at the hearing.
(c) The effective date of action shall be recorded on the notice or ORCHARDS documentation.
(4) BCU shall provide the QED notification of the final fitness determination when the SI is being denied or approved with restrictions.
(a) The notice to the QED shall not contain any details regarding the potentially disqualifying convictions or conditions.
(b) If the final fitness determination is approved with restrictions, BCU shall inform the QED of the restrictions required on the SI and the SI’s position.
(5) When an SI is denied or the background check results in an incomplete fitness determination, the SI shall not be allowed to work, volunteer, be employed, or otherwise perform in the position listed on the background check request. A denial applies only to the position and application in question. A denial or incomplete fitness determination shall result in immediate termination, dismissal, or removal of the SI.
(6) When an SI is approved with restrictions, the SI shall only be allowed to work, volunteer, be employed, or otherwise perform in the position listed on the background check request and only under the stated restrictions. A restricted approval applies only to the position and application in question. A restricted approval shall result in immediate implementation of the restrictions.
(7) BCU shall maintain any documents obtained or created during the background check process.
(8) BCU shall make new fitness determinations for each background check request. The outcome of previous fitness determinations does not set a precedent for subsequent fitness determinations.

OAR 125-007-0300, ORS 183.411 to 183.497, and
the Attorney General’s Uniform and Model Rules of Procedure for the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH), OAR 137-003-0501 to 137-003-0700.
(3)
During the appeal process, the final fitness determination remains in effect.
(a)
If an SI is denied or mandatorily excluded, the SI may not hold the position, provide services or be employed, licensed, certified, or registered, or otherwise perform in positions covered by these rules.
(b) If an SI has an approval with restrictions, the SI may only work under the terms of the restriction listed
on the notice of final fitness determination
.
(4) A positive change does not guarantee employment or placement.
A positive change is either:
(a) A denial changing to an approval or an approval with restrictions; or
(b) An approval with restrictions changing to an approval.
(5) An SI may represent himself or herself or have legal representation during the appeal process. For the purpose of this rule, the term “SI” includes the SI’s legal representative
if the SI has provided the Department with such information

(b) The factors used in the weighing test; or
(c) Any other information used in making the fitness determination.
