<p>3. The amount of the fee, if determined, or a good faith estimate of the fee, if not determined, that the assisted living facility or assisted living home will pay to the referral agency.  The referral agency may describe the fee as a dollar amount or as a percentage of the prospective resident's first month's rent and care charges at the facility or home.</p>

<p>B. After the first instance of the referral agency providing the disclosure required by subsection A of this section, the referral agency shall request from the prospective resident or representative of a prospective resident an acknowledgement of receiving the disclosure in the same manner and form in which the disclosure was delivered.</p>

<p>C. The prospective resident may terminate all services of the referral agency for the prospective resident at any time, including the use of the prospective resident's personal information, by providing a written or electronic termination notice to the referral agency.  If the prospective resident delivers a termination notice, the referral agency is not entitled to any fee for the resident's move-in after the date of the termination notice unless either of the following applies:</p>

<p>1. The assisted living facility or assisted living home chosen by the resident within twelve months after the date of termination was specifically identified and referred to the resident after evaluating the prospective resident's profile and requests before the resident delivered the notice of termination.</p>

<p>2. The referral agency provides documentation to the assisted living facility or assisted living home that the resident communicated with the referral agency for referral services before the resident's admission to the assisted living facility or assisted living home.</p>

<p>D. The referral agency's written, electronic or oral disclosure shall be in the following format and, if written, shall be in fourteen-point font type:</p>

<p>Arizona law requires that we provide you with the following disclosure notice.</p>

<p>We are in the business of referring residents to assisted living facilities and assisted living homes. We will be paid by the facility or home if you move into one of the referred facilities or homes.  The fee we receive from the facility or home into which you move typically ranges from (____) to (____) percent of your first month's rent and care charges or from ($____) to ($____).  We <u>(do/do not)</u> have a current business relationship (but/and) we <u>(do/do not)</u> have a common ownership or control in, or any other financial, business, management or familial relationship with, (any) (one or more) of the homes and facilities to which we are referring you.</p>

<p>By providing us with a written or electronic notice, you have the right to terminate our services to you at any time, including our use of your personal information. If you terminate our services, we will not be entitled to any fee for any move-in you make after the date of the termination notice unless either:</p>

<p>1. The facility or home you choose within the next twelve months is one that we specifically identify and refer to you after we evaluate your profile and requests but before we receive your notice of termination.</p>

<p>2. You communicate with us before you move into the facility or home.</p>

<p>E. Within fourteen days after a resident is admitted to an assisted living facility or assisted living home, the facility or home shall notify the referral agency of the resident's admission if the facility or home is contracted with the referral agency. Not later than fourteen days after receiving notice of the resident's admission, the referral agency shall provide the assisted living facility or assisted living home with a written or electronic copy or recording of the disclosure made to the resident and the resident's acknowledgement of receiving the disclosure as prescribed in subsections B and D of this section, along with the date and time of the disclosure to the resident. The assisted living facility or assisted living home shall maintain a copy of the disclosure for as long as the resident is at the facility or home.  The referral agency shall maintain a copy of the disclosure and acknowledgement for one year.  The assisted living facility or assisted living home shall not pay any referral fee associated with a resident until the facility or home receives the written or electronic copy or recording of the disclosure made to the resident and the resident's acknowledgement of receiving the disclosure provided and maintained in the same manner and form.</p>

<p>F. A referral agency that violates this section is subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each violation. The attorney general or a county attorney may institute a proceeding in superior court to recover the civil penalty under this subsection and to restrain and enjoin a violation of this section. Any civil penalty recovered pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited in the general fund of the jurisdiction that prosecuted the violation.</p>
