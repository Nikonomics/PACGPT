PREFACE
Under Arizona law, the Department of State, Office of the Secretary of State (Office), Administrative Rules Division, accepts state agency
rule notice and other legal filings and is the publisher of Arizona rules. The Office of the Secretary of State does not interpret or enforce rules
in the Administrative Code. Questions about rules should be directed to the state agency responsible for the promulgation of the rule.
Scott Cancelosi, Director
ADMINISTRATIVE RULES DIVISION
RULES
The definition for a rule is provided for under A.R.S. § 41-1001.
“‘Rule’ means an agency statement of general applicability that
implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy, or describes the
procedures or practice requirements of an agency.”
THE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE
The Arizona Administrative Code is where the official rules of the
state of Arizona are published. The Code is the official codification
of rules that govern state agencies, boards, and commissions.
The Code is separated by subject into Titles. Titles are divided into
Chapters. A Chapter includes state agency rules. Rules in Chapters
are divided into Articles, then Sections. The “R” stands for “rule”
with a sequential numbering and lettering outline separated into
subsections.
Rules are codified quarterly in the Code. Supplement release dates
are printed on the footers of each Chapter.
First Quarter: January 1 - March 31
Second Quarter: April 1 - June 30
Third Quarter: July 1 - September 30
Fourth Quarter: October 1 - December 31
For example, the first supplement for the first quarter of 2022 is
cited as Supp. 22-1. Supplements are traditionally released three to
four weeks after the end of the quarter because filings are accepted
until the last day of the quarter.
Please note: The Office publishes by Chapter, not by individual rule
Section. Therefore there might be only a few Sections codified in
each Chapter released in a supplement. This is why the Office lists
only updated codified Sections on the previous page.
RULE HISTORY
Refer to the HISTORICAL NOTE at the end of each Section for the
effective date of a rule. The note also includes the Register volume
and page number in which the notice was published (A.A.R.) and
beginning in supplement 21-4, the date the notice was published in
the Register.
AUTHENTICATION OF PDF CODE CHAPTERS
The Office began to authenticate Chapters of the Code in Supp. 18-
1 to comply with A.R.S. §§ 41-1012(B) and A.R.S. § 41-5505.
A certification verifies the authenticity of each Code Chapter
posted as it is released by the Office of the Secretary of State. The
authenticated pdf of the Code includes an integrity mark with a cer-
tificate ID. Users should check the validity of the signature, espe-
cially if the pdf has been downloaded. If the digital signature is
invalid it means the document’s content has been compromised.
HOW TO USE THE CODE
Rules may be in effect before a supplement is released by the
Office. Therefore, the user should refer to issues of the Arizona
Administrative Register for recent updates to rule Sections.
ARIZONA REVISED STATUTE REFERENCES
The Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) are available online at the
Legislature’s website, www.azleg.gov. An agency’s authority note
to make rules is often included at the beginning of a Chapter. Other
Arizona statutes may be referenced in rule under the A.R.S. acro-
nym.
SESSION LAW REFERENCES
Arizona Session Law references in a Chapter can be found at the
Secretary of State’s website, www.azsos.gov under Services-> Leg-
islative Filings.
EXEMPTIONS FROM THE APA
It is not uncommon for an agency to be exempt from the steps out-
lined in the rulemaking process as specified in the Arizona Admin-
istrative Procedures Act, also known as the APA (Arizona Revised
Statutes, Title 41, Chapter 6, Articles 1 through 10). Other agencies
may be given an exemption to certain provisions of the Act.
An agency’s exemption is written in law by the Arizona State Leg-
islature or under a referendum or initiative passed into law by Ari-
zona voters.
When an agency files an exempt rulemaking package with our
Office it specifies the law exemption in what is called the preamble
of rulemaking. The preamble is published in the Register online at
www.azsos.gov/rules, click on the Administrative Register link.
Editor’s notes at the beginning of a Chapter provide information
about rulemaking Sections made by exempt rulemaking. Exempt
rulemaking notes are also included in the historical note at the end
of a rulemaking Section.
The Office makes a distinction to certain exemptions because some
rules are made without receiving input from stakeholders or the
public. Other exemptions may require an agency to propose exempt
rules at a public hearing.
PERSONAL USE/COMMERCIAL USE

Rehearing or Review of Decision
A.
The Board shall provide for a rehearing and review of its deci-
sions under A.R.S. Title 41, Chapter 6, Article 10 and the rules
established by the Office of Administrative Hearings.
B.
Except as provided in subsection (I), a party is required to file
a motion for rehearing or review of a decision of the Board to
exhaust the party’s administrative remedies.
C.
A party may amend a motion for rehearing or review at any
time before the Board rules on the motion.
D.
The Board may grant a rehearing or review for any of the fol-
lowing reasons materially affecting a party’s rights:
1.
Irregularity in the proceedings of the Board or any order
or abuse of discretion that deprived the moving party of a
fair hearing;
2.
Misconduct of the Board, its staff, or an administrative
law judge;
3.
Accident or surprise that could not have been prevented
by ordinary prudence;
4.
Newly discovered material evidence that could not, with
reasonable diligence, have been discovered and produced
at the hearing;
5.
Excessive or insufficient penalty;
6.
Error in the admission or rejection of evidence or other
errors of law occurring at the hearing or during the prog-
ress of the proceedings; and
7.
The findings of fact or decision is not justified by the evi-
dence or is contrary to law.
E.
The Board may affirm or modify a decision or grant a rehear-
ing or review to all or some of the parties on all or some of the
issues for any of the reasons listed in subsection (D). An order
modifying a decision or granting a rehearing or review shall
specify with particularity the grounds for the order. If a rehear-
ing or review is granted, the rehearing or review shall cover
only the matters specified in the order.
F.
Not later than 30 days after the date of a decision and after giv-
ing the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard, the Board
may, on its own initiative, order a rehearing or review of its
decision for any reason it might have granted a rehearing or
review on motion of a party. The Board may grant a motion for
rehearing or review, timely served, for a reason not stated in
the motion. An order granting a rehearing or review shall spec-
ify with particularity the grounds on which the rehearing or
review is granted.
G.
When a motion for rehearing is based upon affidavits, they
shall be served with the motion. An opposing party may,
within 15 days after service, serve opposing affidavits. This
period may be extended by the Board for a maximum of 20
days for good cause as described in subsection (H) or by writ-
ten stipulation of the parties. Reply affidavits may be permit-
ted.
H.
The Board may extend all time limits listed in this Section
upon a showing of good cause. A party demonstrates good
cause by showing that the grounds for the party’s motion or
other action could not have been known in time, using reason-
able diligence, and a ruling on the motion will:
1.
Further administrative convenience, expedition, or econ-
omy; or
2.
Avoid undue prejudice to any party.
I.
If, in a particular decision, the Board makes a specific finding
that the immediate effectiveness of the decision is necessary
for immediate preservation of the public health, safety, or wel-
fare and that a rehearing or review of the decision is impracti-
cable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, the
decision may be issued as a final decision without an opportu-
nity for a rehearing or review. If an application for judicial
review of the decision is made, it shall be made under A.R.S. §
12-901 et seq.
