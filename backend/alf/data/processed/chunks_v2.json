PURPOSE.\n\nThis document sets guidelines for accessibility to places of public accommodation and commercial facilities by individuals with disabilities. These guidelines are to be applied during the design, construction, and alteration of such buildings and facilities to the extent required by regulations issued by Federal agencies, including the Department of Justice, under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\n\nThe technical specifications 4.2 through 4.35, of these guidelines are the same as those of the American National Standard Institute's document A117.1-1980, except as noted in this text by italics. However, sections 4.1.1 through 4.1.7 and sections 5 through 10 are different from ANSI A117.1 in their entirety and are printed in standard type.\n\nThe illustrations and text of ANSI A117.1 are reproduced with permission from the American National Standards Institute. Copies of the standard may be purchased from the American National Standards Institute at 1430 Broadway, New York, New York 10018.\n\n2. GENERAL.",

(8) In new construction, at a minimum, the requirements in (a) and (b) below shall be satisfied independently:\n\n(a)(i) At least 50% of all public entrances (excluding those in (b) below) must be accessible. At least one must be a ground floor entrance. Public entrances are any entrances that are not loading or service entrances.\n\n(ii) Accessible entrances must be provided in a number at least equivalent to the number of exits required by the applicable building/fire codes. (This paragraph does not require an increase in the total number of entrances planned for a facility.)\n\n(iii) An accessible entrance must be provided to each tenancy in a facility (for example, individual stores in a strip shopping center).\n\nOne entrance may be considered as meeting more than one of the requirements in (a). Where feasible, accessible entrances shall be the entrances used by the majority of people visiting or working in the building.\n\n(b)(i) In addition, if direct access is provided for pedestrians from an enclosed parking garage to the building, at least one direct entrance from the garage to the building must be accessible.\n\n(ii) If access is provided for pedestrians from a pedestrian tunnel or elevated walkway, one entrance to the building from each tunnel or walkway must be accessible.\n\nOne entrance may be considered as meeting more than one of the requirements in (b).\n\nBecause entrances also serve as emergency exits whose proximity to all parts of buildings and facilities is essential, it is preferable that all entrances be accessible.\n\n(c) If the only entrance to a building, or tenancy in a facility, is a service entrance, that entrance shall be accessible.\n\n(d) Entrances which are not accessible shall have directional signage complying with 4.30.1, 4.30.2, 4.30.3, and 4.30.5, which indicates the location of the nearest accessible entrance.\n\n(9)* In buildings or facilities, or portions of buildings or facilities, required to be accessible, accessible means of egress shall be provided in the same number as required for exits by local building/life safety regulations. Where a required exit from an occupiable level above or below a level of accessible exit discharge is not accessible, an area of rescue assistance shall be provided on each such level (in a number equal to that of inaccessible required exits). Areas of rescue assistance shall comply with 4.3.\n\n11. A horizontal exit, meeting the requirements of local building/life safety regulations, shall satisfy the requirement for an area of rescue assistance.\n\nEXCEPTION: Areas of rescue assistance are not required in buildings or facilities having a supervised automatic sprinkler system.\n\n(10)* Drinking Fountains:\n\n(a) Where only one drinking fountain is provided on a floor there shall be a drinking fountain which is accessible to individuals who use wheelchairs in accordance with 4.15 and one accessible to those who have difficulty bending or stooping. (This can be accommodated by the use of a \"hi-lo\" fountain; by providing one fountain accessible to those who use wheelchairs and one fountain at a standard height convenient for those who have difficulty bending; by providing a fountain accessible under 4.15 and a water cooler; or by such other means as would achieve the required accessibility for each group on each floor.)\n\n(b) Where more than one drinking fountain or water cooler is provided on a floor, 50% of those provided shall comply with 4.15 and shall be on an accessible route.\n\n(11) Toilet Facilities: If toilet rooms are provided, then each public and common use toilet room shall comply with 4.\n\n22. Other toilet rooms provided for the use of occupants of specific spaces (i.e., a private toilet room for the occupant of a private office) shall be adaptable. If bathing rooms are provided, then each public and common use bathroom shall comply with 4.\n\n23. Accessible toilet rooms and bathing facilities shall be on an accessible route.",

    "content": "4.1.6 Accessible Buildings: Alterations.\n\n(1) General. Alterations to existing buildings and facilities shall comply with the following:\n\n(a) No alteration shall be undertaken which decreases or has the effect of decreasing accessibility or usability of a building or facility below the requirements for new construction at the time of alteration.\n\n(b) If existing elements, spaces, or common areas are altered, then each such altered element, space, feature, or area shall comply with the applicable provisions of 4.1.1 to 4.1.3 Minimum Requirements (for New Construction). If the applicable provision for new construction requires that an element, space, or common area be on an accessible route, the altered element, space, or common area is not required to be on an accessible route except as provided in 4.1.6(2) (Alterations to an Area Containing a Primary Function.)\n\n(c) If alterations of single elements, when considered together, amount to an alteration of a room or space in a building or facility, the entire space shall be made accessible.\n\n(d) No alteration of an existing element, space, or area of a building or facility shall impose a requirement for greater accessibility than that which would be required for new construction. For example, if the elevators and stairs in a building are being altered and the elevators are, in turn, being made accessible, then no accessibility modifications are required to the stairs connecting levels connected by the elevator. If stair modifications to correct unsafe conditions are required by other codes, the modifications shall be done in compliance with these guidelines unless technically infeasible.\n\n(e) At least one interior public text telephone complying with 4.31.9 shall be provided if:\n\n(i) alterations to existing buildings or facilities with less than four exterior or interior public pay telephones would increase the total number to four or more telephones with at least one in an interior location; or\n\n(ii) alterations to one or more exterior or interior public pay telephones occur in an existing building or facility with four or more public telephones with at least one in an interior location.\n\n(f) If an escalator or stair is planned or installed where none existed previously and major structural modifications are necessary for such installation, then a means of accessible vertical access shall be provided that complies with the applicable provisions of 4.7, 4.8, 4.10, or 4.\n\n11. (g) In alterations, the requirements of 4.1.3(9), 4.3.10 and 4.3.11 do not apply.\n\n(h)* Entrances: If a planned alteration entails alterations to an entrance, and the building has an accessible entrance, the entrance being altered is not required to comply with 4.1.3(8), except to the extent required by 4.1.6(2). If a particular entrance is not made accessible, appropriate accessible signage indicating the location of the nearest accessible entrance(s) shall be installed at or near the inaccessible entrance, such that a person with disabilities will not be required to retrace the approach route from the inaccessible entrance.\n\n(i) If the alteration work is limited solely to the electrical, mechanical, or plumbing system, or to hazardous material abatement, or automatic sprinkler retrofitting, and does not involve the alteration of any elements or spaces required to be accessible under these guidelines, then 4.1.6(2) does not apply.\n\n(j) EXCEPTION: In alteration work, if compliance with 4.1.6 is technically infeasible, the alteration shall provide accessibility to the maximum extent feasible. Any elements or features of the building or facility that are being altered and can be made accessible shall be made accessible within the scope of the alteration.\n\nTechnically Infeasible. Means, with respect to an alteration of a building or a facility, that it has little likelihood of being accomplished because existing structural conditions would require removing or altering a load-bearing member which is an essential part of the structural frame; or because other existing physical or site constraints prohibit modification or addition of elements, spaces, or features which are in full and strict compliance with the minimum requirements for new construction and which are necessary to provide accessibility.\n\n(k) EXCEPTION:\n\n(i) These guidelines do not require the installation of an elevator in an altered facility that is less than three stories or has less than 3,000 square feet per story unless the building is a shopping center, a shopping mall, the professional office of a health care provider, or another type of facility as determined by the Attorney General.\n\n(ii) The exemption provided in paragraph (i) does not obviate or limit in any way the obligation to comply with the other accessibility requirements established in these guidelines. For example, alterations to floors above or below the ground floor must be accessible regardless of whether the altered facility has an elevator. If a facility subject to the elevator exemption set forth in paragraph (i) nonetheless has a full passenger elevator, that elevator shall meet, to the maximum extent feasible, the accessibility requirements of these guidelines.\n\n(2) Alterations to an Area Containing a Primary Function: In addition to the requirements of 4.1.6(1), an alteration that affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function shall be made so as to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered area and the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area, are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, unless such alterations are disproportionate to the overall alterations in terms of cost and scope (as determined under criteria established by the Attorney General).\n\n(3) Special Technical Provisions for Alterations to Existing Buildings and Facilities:\n\n(a) Ramps: Curb ramps and interior or exterior ramps to be constructed on sites or in existing buildings or facilities where space limitations prohibit the use of a 1:12 slope or less may have slopes and rises as follows:\n\n(i) A slope between 1:10 and 1:12 is allowed for a maximum rise of 6 inches.\n\n(ii) A slope between 1:8 and 1:10 is allowed for a maximum rise of 3 inches. A slope steeper than 1:8 is not allowed.\n\n(b) Stairs: Full extension of handrails at stairs shall not be required in alterations where such extensions would be hazardous or impossible due to plan configuration.\n\n(c) Elevators:\n\n(i) If safety door edges are provided in existing automatic elevators, automatic door reopening devices may be omitted (see 4.10.6).\n\n(ii) Where existing shaft configuration or technical infeasibility prohibits strict compliance with 4.10.9, the minimum car plan dimensions may be reduced by the minimum amount necessary, but in no case shall the inside car area be smaller than 48 in by 48 in.\n\n(iii) Equivalent facilitation may be provided with an elevator car of different dimensions when usability can be demonstrated and when all other elements required to be accessible comply with the applicable provisions of 4.\n\n10. For example, an elevator of 47 in by 69 in (1195 mm by 1755 mm) with a door opening on the narrow dimension, could accommodate the standard wheelchair clearances shown in Figure 4.",

Where there are a series of individual work stations of the same type (e.g., laboratories, service counters, ticket booths), 5%, but not less than one, of each type of work station should be constructed so that an individual with disabilities can maneuver within the work stations. Rooms housing individual offices in a typical office building must meet the requirements of the guidelines concerning doors, accessible routes, etc. but do not need to allow for maneuvering space around individual desks. Modifications required to permit maneuvering within the work area may be accomplished as a reasonable accommodation to individual employees with disabilities under Title I of the ADA.\n\nConsideration should also be given to placing shelves in employee work areas at a convenient height for accessibility or installing commercially available shelving that is adjustable so that reasonable accommodations can be made in the future.\n\nIf work stations are made accessible they should comply with the applicable provisions of 4.2 through 4.\n\n35. A4.1.2 Accessible Sites and Exterior Facilities: New Construction.\n\nA4.1.2(5)(e) Valet Parking. Valet parking is not always usable by individuals with disabilities. For instance, an individual may use a type of vehicle controls that render the regular controls inoperable or the driver's seat in a van may be removed. In these situations, another person cannot park the vehicle. It is recommended that some self-parking spaces be provided at valet parking facilities for individuals whose vehicles cannot be parked by another person and that such spaces be located on an accessible route to the entrance of the facility.\n\nA4.1.3 Accessible Buildings: New Construction.\n\nA4.1.3(5) Only full passenger elevators are covered by the accessibility provisions of 4.\n\n10. Materials and equipment hoists, freight elevators not intended for passenger use, dumbwaiters, and construction elevators are not covered by these guidelines. If a building is exempt from the elevator requirement, it is not necessary to provide a platform lift or other means of vertical access in lieu of an elevator.\n\nUnder Exception 4, platform lifts are allowed where existing conditions make it impractical to install a ramp or elevator. Such conditions generally occur where it is essential to provide access to small raised or lowered areas where space may not be available for a ramp. Examples include, but are not limited to, raised pharmacy platforms, commercial offices raised above a sales floor, or radio and news booths.\n\nA4.1.3(9) Supervised automatic sprinkler systems have built in signals for monitoring features of the system such as the opening and closing of water control valves, the power supplies for needed pumps, water tank levels, and for indicating conditions that will impair the satisfactory operation of the sprinkler system. Because of these monitoring features, supervised automatic sprinkler systems have a high level of satisfactory performance and response to fire conditions.\n\nA4.1.3(10) If an odd number of drinking fountains is provided on a floor, the requirement in 4.1.3(10)(b) may be met by rounding down the odd number to an even number and calculating 50% of the even number. When more than one drinking fountain on a floor is required to comply with 4.15, those fountains should be dispersed to allow wheelchair users convenient access. For example, in a large facility such as a convention center that has water fountains at several locations on a floor, the accessible water fountains should be located so that wheelchair users do not have to travel a greater distance than other people to use a drinking fountain.\n\nA4.1.3(17)(b) In addition to the requirements of section 4.1.3(17)(b), the installation of additional volume controls is encouraged. Volume controls may be installed on any telephone.\n\nA4.1.3(19)(a) Readily removable or folding seating units may be installed in lieu of providing an open space for wheelchair users. Folding seating units are usually two fixed seats that can be easily folded into a fixed center bar to allow for one or two open spaces for wheelchair users when necessary. These units are more easily adapted than removable seats which generally require the seat to be removed in advance by the facility management.\n\nEither a sign or a marker placed on seating with removable or folding arm rests is required by this section. Consideration should be given for ensuring identification of such seats in a darkened theater. For example, a marker which contrasts (light on dark or dark on light) and which also reflects light could be placed on the side of such seating so as to be visible in a lighted auditorium and also to reflect light from a flashlight.\n\nA4.1.6 Accessible Buildings: Alterations.\n\nA4.1.6(1)(h) When an entrance is being altered, it is preferable that those entrances being altered be made accessible to the extent feasible.\n\nA4.2 Space Allowances and Reach Ranges.\n\nA4.2.1 Wheelchair Passage Width.",

    "content": "A4.2.1 Wheelchair Passage Width.\n\n(1) Space Requirements for Wheelchairs. Many persons who use wheelchairs need a 30 in (760 mm) clear opening width for doorways, gates, and the like, when the latter are entered head-on. If the person is unfamiliar with a building, if competing traffic is heavy, if sudden or frequent movements are needed, or if the wheelchair must be turned at an opening, then greater clear widths are needed. For most situations, the addition of an inch of leeway on either side is sufficient. Thus, a minimum clear width of 32 in (815 mm) will provide adequate clearance. However, when an opening or a restriction in a passageway is more than 24 in (610 mm) long, it is essentially a passageway and must be at least 36 in (915 mm) wide.\n\n(2) Space Requirements for Use of Walking Aids. Although people who use walking aids can maneuver through clear width openings of 32 in (815 mm), they need 36 in (915 mm) wide passageways and walks for comfortable gaits. Crutch tips, often extending down at a wide angle, are a hazard in narrow passageways where they might not be seen by other pedestrians. Thus, the 36 in (915 mm) width provides a safety allowance both for the person with a disability and for others.\n\n(3) Space Requirements for Passing. Able-bodied persons in winter clothing, walking straight ahead with arms swinging, need 32 in (815 mm) of width, which includes 2 in (50 mm) on either side for sway, and another 1 in (25 mm) tolerance on either side for clearing nearby objects or other pedestrians. Almost all wheelchair users and those who use walking aids can also manage within this 32 in (815 mm) width for short distances. Thus, two streams of traffic can pass in 64 in (1625 mm) in a comfortable flow. Sixty inches (1525 mm) provides a minimum width for a somewhat more restricted flow. If the clear width is less than 60 in (1525 mm), two wheelchair users will not be able to pass but will have to seek a wider place for passing. Forty-eight inches (1220 mm) is the minimum width needed for an ambulatory person to pass a nonambulatory or semi-ambulatory person. Within this 48 in (1220 mm) width, the ambulatory person will have to twist to pass a wheelchair user, a person with a service animal, or a semi-ambulatory person. There will be little leeway for swaying or missteps (see Fig. A1).\n\nA4.2.3 Wheelchair Turning Space.\nThese guidelines specify a minimum space of 60 in (1525 mm) diameter or a 60 in by 60 in (1525 mm by 1525 mm) T-shaped space for a pivoting 180-degree turn of a wheelchair. This space is usually satisfactory for turning around, but many people will not be able to turn without repeated tries and bumping into surrounding objects. The space shown in Fig. A2 will allow most wheelchair users to complete U-turns without difficulty.\n\nA4.2.4 Clear Floor or Ground Space for Wheelchairs. The wheelchair and user shown in Fig. A3 represent typical dimensions for a large adult male. The space requirements in this guideline are based upon maneuvering clearances that will accommodate most wheelchairs. Fig. A3 provides a uniform reference for design not covered by this guideline.\n\nA4.2.5 & A4.2.6 Reach. Reach ranges for persons seated in wheelchairs may be further clarified by Fig. A3(a). These drawings approximate in the plan view the information shown in Fig. 4, 5, and 6.\n\nA4.3 Accessible Route.\n\nA4.3.1 General.\n\n(1) Travel Distances. Many people with mobility impairments can move at only very slow speeds; for many, traveling 200 ft (61 m) could take about 2 minutes. This assumes a rate of about 1.5 ft/s (455 mm/s) on level ground. It also assumes that the traveler would move continuously. However, on trips over 100 ft (30 m), disabled people are apt to rest frequently, which substantially increases their trip times. Resting periods of 2 minutes for every 100 ft (30 m) can be used to estimate travel times for people with severely limited stamina. In inclement weather, slow progress and resting can greatly increase a disabled person's exposure to the elements.\n\n(2) Sites. Level, indirect routes or those with running slopes lower than 1:20 can sometimes provide more convenience than direct routes with maximum allowable slopes or with ramps.\n\nA4.3.10 Egress. Because people with disabilities may visit, be employed or be a resident in any building, emergency management plans with specific provisions to ensure their safe evacuation also play an essential role in fire safety and life safety.\n\nA4.3.11.3 Stairway Width. A 48 in (1220 mm) wide exit stairway is needed to allow assisted evacuation (e.g., carrying a person in a wheelchair) without encroaching on the exit path for ambulatory persons.\n\nA4.3.11.4 Two-way Communication. It is essential that emergency communication not be dependent on voice communications alone because the safety of people with hearing or speech impairments could be jeopardized. The visible signal requirement could be satisfied with something as simple as a button in the area of rescue assistance that lights, indicating that help is on the way, when the message is answered at the point of entry.\n\nA4.4 Protruding Objects.\n\nA4.4.1 General. Service animals are trained to recognize and avoid hazards. However, most people with severe impairments of vision use the long cane as an aid to mobility. The two principal cane techniques are the touch technique, where the cane arcs from side to side and touches points outside both shoulders; and the diagonal technique, where the cane is held in a stationary position diagonally across the body with the cane tip touching or just above the ground at a point outside one shoulder and the handle or grip extending to a point outside the other shoulder. The touch technique is used primarily in uncontrolled areas, while the diagonal technique is used primarily in certain limited, controlled, and familiar environments. Cane users are often trained to use both techniques.\n\nPotential hazardous objects are noticed only if they fall within the detection range of canes (see Fig. A4). Visually impaired people walking toward an object can detect an overhang if its lowest surface is not higher than 27 in (685 mm). When walking alongside protruding objects, they cannot detect overhangs. Since proper cane and service animal techniques keep people away from the edge of a path or from walls, a slight overhang of no more than 4 in (100 mm) is not hazardous.\n\nA4.5 Ground and Floor Surfaces.\n\nA4.5.1 General. People who have difficulty walking or maintaining balance or who use crutches, canes, or walkers, and those with restricted gaits are particularly sensitive to slipping and tripping hazards. For such people, a stable and regular surface is necessary for safe walking, particularly on stairs. Wheelchairs can be propelled most easily on surfaces that are hard, stable, and regular. Soft loose surfaces such as shag carpet, loose sand or gravel, wet clay, and irregular surfaces such as cobblestones can significantly impede wheelchair movement.",

    "content": "Soft loose surfaces such as shag carpet, loose sand or gravel, wet clay, and irregular surfaces such as cobblestones can significantly impede wheelchair movement.\n\nSlip resistance is based on the frictional force necessary to keep a shoe heel or crutch tip from slipping on a walking surface under conditions likely to be found on the surface. While the dynamic coefficient of friction during walking varies in a complex and non-uniform way, the static coefficient of friction, which can be measured in several ways, provides a close approximation of the slip resistance of a surface. Contrary to popular belief, some slippage is necessary to walking, especially for persons with restricted gaits; a truly \"non-slip\" surface could not be negotiated.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends that walking surfaces have a static coefficient of friction of 0.\n\n5. A research project sponsored by the Architectural and\n\nTransportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) conducted tests with persons with disabilities and concluded that a higher coefficient of friction was needed by such persons. A static coefficient of friction of 0.6 is recommended for accessible routes and 0.8 for ramps.\n\nIt is recognized that the coefficient of friction varies considerably due to the presence of contaminants, water, floor finishes, and other factors not under the control of the designer or builder and not subject to design and construction guidelines and that compliance would be difficult to measure on the building site. Nevertheless, many common building materials suitable for flooring are now labeled with information on the static coefficient of friction. While it may not be possible to compare one product directly with another, or to guarantee a constant measure, builders and designers are encouraged to specify materials with appropriate values. As more products include information on slip resistance, improved uniformity in measurement and specification is likely. The Access Board's advisory guidelines on Slip Resistant Surfaces provides additional information on this subject.\n\nCross slopes on walks and ground or floor surfaces can cause considerable difficulty in propelling a wheelchair in a straight line.\n\nA4.5.3 Carpet. Much more needs to be done in developing both quantitative and qualitative criteria for carpeting (i.e., problems associated with texture and weave need to be studied). However, certain functional characteristics are well established. When both carpet and padding are used, it is desirable to have minimum movement (preferably none) between the floor and the pad and the pad and the carpet which would allow the carpet to hump or warp. In heavily trafficked areas, a thick, soft (plush) pad or cushion, particularly in combination with long carpet pile, makes it difficult for individuals in wheelchairs and those with other ambulatory disabilities to get about. Firm carpeting can be achieved through proper selection and combination of pad and carpet, sometimes with the elimination of the pad or cushion, and with proper installation. Carpeting designed with a weave that causes a zig-zag effect when wheeled across is strongly discouraged.\n\nA4.6 Parking and Passenger Loading Zones.\n\nA4.6.3 Parking Spaces. The increasing use of vans with side-mounted lifts or ramps by persons with disabilities has necessitated some revisions in specifications for parking spaces and adjacent access aisles. The typical accessible parking space is 96 in (2440 mm) wide with an adjacent 60 in (1525 mm) access aisle. However, this aisle does not permit lifts or ramps to be deployed and still leave room for a person using a wheelchair or other mobility aid to exit the lift platform or ramp. In tests conducted with actual lift/van/wheelchair combinations, (under a Board-sponsored Accessible Parking and Loading Zones Project) researchers found that a space and aisle totaling almost 204 in (5180 mm) wide was needed to deploy a lift and exit conveniently. The \"van accessible\" parking space required by these guidelines provides a 96 in (2440 mm) wide space with a 96 in (2440 mm) adjacent access aisle which is just wide enough to maneuver and exit from a side mounted lift. If a 96 in (2440 mm) access aisle is placed between two spaces, two \"van accessible\" spaces are created. Alternatively, if the wide access aisle is provided at the end of a row (an area often unused), it may be possible to provide the wide access aisle without additional space (see Fig. A5(a)).\n\nA sign is needed to alert van users to the presence of the wider aisle, but the space is not intended to be restricted only to vans.\n\n\"Universal\" Parking Space Design. An alternative to the provision of a percentage of spaces with a wide aisle, and the associated need to include additional signage, is the use of what has been called the \"universal\" parking space design. Under this design, all accessible spaces are 132 in (3350 mm) wide with a 60 in (1525 mm) access aisle (see Fig. A5(b)). One advantage to this design is that no additional signage is needed because all spaces can accommodate a van with a side-mounted lift or ramp. Also, there is no competition between cars and vans for spaces since all spaces can accommodate either. Furthermore, the wider space permits vehicles to park to one side or the other within the 132 in (3350 mm) space to allow persons to exit and enter the vehicle on either the driver or passenger side, although, in some cases, this would require exiting or entering without a marked access aisle.\n\nAn essential consideration for any design is having the access aisle level with the parking space. Since a person with a disability, using a lift or ramp, must maneuver within the access aisle, the aisle cannot include a ramp or sloped area. The access aisle must be connected to an accessible route to the appropriate accessible entrance of a building or facility. The parking access aisle must either blend with the accessible route or have a curb ramp complying with 4.\n\n7. Such a curb ramp opening must be located within the access aisle boundaries, not within the parking space boundaries. Unfortunately, many facilities are designed with a ramp that is blocked when any vehicle parks in the accessible space. Also, the required dimensions of the access aisle cannot be restricted by planters, curbs or wheel stops.\n\nA4.6.4 Signage. Signs designating parking places for disabled people can be seen from a driver's seat if the signs are mounted high enough above the ground and located at the front of a parking space.\n\nA4.6.5 Vertical Clearance. High-top vans, which disabled people or transportation services often use, require higher clearances in parking garages than automobiles.\n\nA4.8 Ramps.\n\nA4.8.1 General. Ramps are essential for wheelchair users if elevators or lifts are not available to connect different levels. However, some people who use walking aids have difficulty with ramps and prefer stairs.\n\nA4.8.2 Slope and Rise. Ramp slopes between 1:16 and 1:20 are preferred. The ability to manage an incline is related to both its slope and its length. Wheelchair users with disabilities affecting their arms or with low stamina have serious difficulty using inclines. Most ambulatory people and most people who use wheelchairs can manage a slope of 1:\n\n16. Many people cannot manage a slope of 1:12 for 30 ft (9 m).",

Level landings are essential toward maintaining an aggregate slope that complies with these guidelines. A ramp landing that is not level causes individuals using wheelchairs to tip backward or bottom out when the ramp is approached.\n\nA4.8.5 Handrails. The requirements for stair and ramp handrails in this guideline are for adults. When children are principal users in a building or facility, a second set of handrails at an appropriate height can assist them and aid in preventing accidents.\n\nA4.9 Stairs.\n\nA4.9.1 Minimum Number. Only interior and exterior stairs connecting levels that are not connected by an elevator, ramp, or other accessible means of vertical access have to comply with 4.\n\n9. A4.10 Elevators.\n\nA4.10.6 Door Protective and Reopening Device. The required door reopening device would hold the door open for 20 seconds if the doorway remains obstructed. After 20 seconds, the door may begin to close. However, if designed in accordance with ASME A17.1-1990, the door closing movement could still be stopped if a person or object exerts sufficient force at any point on the door edge.\n\nA4.10.7 Door and Signal Timing for Hall Calls. This paragraph allows variation in the location of call buttons, advance time for warning signals, and the door-holding period used to meet the time requirement.\n\nA4.10.12 Car Controls. Industry-wide standardization of elevator control panel design would make all elevators significantly more convenient for use by people with severe visual impairments. In many cases, it will be possible to locate the highest control on elevator panels within 48 in (1220 mm) from the floor.\n\nA4.10.13 Car Position Indicators. A special button may be provided that would activate the audible signal within the given elevator only for the desired trip, rather than maintaining the audible signal in constant operation.\n\nA4.10.14 Emergency Communications. A device that requires no handset is easier to use by people who have difficulty reaching. Also, small handles on handset compartment doors are not usable by people who have difficulty grasping.\n\nIdeally, emergency two-way communication systems should provide both voice and visual display intercommunication so that persons with hearing impairments and persons with vision impairments can receive information regarding the status of a rescue. A voice intercommunication system cannot be the only means of communication because it is not accessible to people with speech and hearing impairments. While a voice intercommunication system is not required, at a minimum, the system should provide both an audio and visual indication that a rescue is on the way.\n\nA4.11 Platform Lifts (Wheelchair Lifts).\n\nA4.11.2 Other Requirements. Inclined stairway chairlifts, and inclined and vertical platform lifts (wheelchair lifts) are available for short-distance, vertical transportation of people with disabilities. Care should be taken in selecting lifts as some lifts are not equally suitable for use by both wheelchair users and semi-ambulatory individuals.\n\nA4.12 Windows.\n\nA4.12.1 General. Windows intended to be operated by occupants in accessible spaces should comply with 4.\n\n12. A4.12.2 Window Hardware. Windows requiring pushing, pulling, or lifting to open (for example, double-hung, sliding, or casement and awning units without cranks) should require no more than 5 lbf (22.2 N) to open or close. Locks, cranks, and other window hardware should comply with 4.\n\n27. A4.13 Doors.\n\nA4.13.8 Thresholds at Doorways. Thresholds and surface height changes in doorways are particularly inconvenient for wheelchair users who also have low stamina or restrictions in arm movement because complex maneuvering is required to get over the level change while operating the door.\n\nA4.13.9 Door Hardware. Some disabled persons must push against a door with their chair or walker to open it. Applied kickplates on doors with closers can reduce required maintenance by withstanding abuse from wheelchairs and canes. To be effective, they should cover the door width, less approximately 2 in (51 mm), up to a height of 16 in (405 mm) from its bottom edge and be centered across the width of the door.\n\nA4.13.10 Door Closers. Closers with delayed action features give a person more time to maneuver through doorways. They are particularly useful on frequently used interior doors such as entrances to toilet rooms.\n\nA4.13.11 Door Opening Force. Although most people with disabilities can exert at least 5 lbf (22.2N), both pushing and pulling from a stationary position, a few people with severe disabilities cannot exert 3 lbf (13.13N). Although some people cannot manage the allowable forces in this guideline and many others have difficulty, door closers must have certain minimum closing forces to close doors satisfactorily. Forces for pushing or pulling doors open are measured with a push-pull scale under the following conditions:\n\n(1) Hinged doors: Force applied perpendicular to the door at the door opener or 30 in (760 mm) from the hinged side, whichever is farther from the hinge.\n\n(2) Sliding or folding doors: Force applied parallel to the door at the door pull or latch.\n\n(3) Application of force: Apply force gradually so that the applied force does not exceed the resistance of the door. In high-rise buildings, air-pressure differentials may require a modification of this specification in order to meet the functional intent.\n\nA4.13.12 Automatic Doors and Power-Assisted Doors. Sliding automatic doors do not need guard rails and are more convenient for wheelchair users and visually impaired people to use. If slowly opening automatic doors can be reactivated before their closing cycle is completed, they will be more convenient in busy doorways.\n\nA4.15 Drinking Fountains and Water Coolers.\n\nA4.15.2 Spout Height. Two drinking fountains, mounted side by side or on a single post, are usable by people with disabilities and people who find it difficult to bend over.\n\nA4.16 Water Closets.\n\nA4.16.3 Height. Height preferences for toilet seats vary considerably among disabled people. Higher seat heights may be an advantage to some ambulatory disabled people, but are often a disadvantage for wheelchair users and others. Toilet seats 18 in (455 mm) high seem to be a reasonable compromise. Thick seats and filler rings are available to adapt standard fixtures to these requirements.\n\nA4.16.4 Grab Bars. Fig. A6(a) and (b) show the diagonal and side approaches most commonly used to transfer from a wheelchair to a water closet. Some wheelchair users can transfer from the front of the toilet while others use a 90-degree approach. Most people who use the two additional approaches can also use either the diagonal approach or the side approach.\n\nA4.16.5 Flush Controls. Flush valves and related plumbing can be located behind walls or to the side of the toilet, or a toilet seat lid can be provided if plumbing fittings are directly behind the toilet seat. Such designs reduce the chance of injury and imbalance caused by leaning back against the fittings. Flush controls for tank-type toilets have a standardized mounting location on the left side of the tank (facing the tank). Tanks can be obtained by special order with controls mounted on the right side. If administrative authorities require flush controls for flush valves to be located in a position that conflicts with the location of the rear grab bar, then that bar may be split or shifted toward the wide side of the toilet area.\n\nA4.17 Toilet Stalls.",

    "content": "A4.17 Toilet Stalls.\n\nA4.17.3 Size and Arrangement. This section requires use of the 60 in (1525 mm) standard stall (Figure 30(a)) and permits the 36 in (915 mm) or 48 in (1220 mm) wide alternate stall (Figure 30(b)) only in alterations where provision of the standard stall is technically infeasible or where local plumbing codes prohibit reduction in the number of fixtures. A standard stall provides a clear space on one side of the water closet to enable persons who use wheelchairs to perform a side or diagonal transfer from the wheelchair to the water closet. However, some persons with disabilities who use mobility aids such as walkers, canes or crutches are better able to use the two parallel grab bars in the 36 in (915 mm) wide alternate stall to achieve a standing position.\n\nIn large toilet rooms, where six or more toilet stalls are provided, it is therefore required that a 36 in (915 mm) wide stall with parallel grab bars be provided in addition to the standard stall required in new construction. The 36 in (915 mm) width is necessary to achieve proper use of the grab bars; wider stalls would position the grab bars too far apart to be easily used and narrower stalls would position the grab bars too close to the water closet. Since the stall is primarily intended for use by persons using canes, crutches and walkers, rather than wheelchairs, the length of the stall could be conventional. The door, however, must swing outward to ensure a usable space for people who use crutches or walkers.\n\nA4.17.5 Doors. To make it easier for wheelchair users to close toilet stall doors, doors can be provided with closers, spring hinges, or a pull bar mounted on the inside surface of the door near the hinge side.\n\nA4.19 Lavatories and Mirrors.\n\nA4.19.6 Mirrors. If mirrors are to be used by both ambulatory people and wheelchair users, then they must be at least 74 in (1880 mm) high at their topmost edge. A single full length mirror can accommodate all people, including children.\n\nA4.21 Shower Stalls.\n\nA4.21.1 General. Shower stalls that are 36 in by 36 in (915 mm by 915 mm) wide provide additional safety to people who have difficulty maintaining balance because all grab bars and walls are within easy reach. Seated people use the walls of 36 in by 36 in (915 mm by 915 mm) showers for back support. Shower stalls that are 60 in (1525 mm) wide and have no curb may increase usability of a bathroom by wheelchair users because the shower area provides additional maneuvering space.\n\nA4.22 Toilet Rooms.\n\nA4.22.3 Clear Floor Space. In many small facilities, single-user restrooms may be the only facilities provided for all building users. In addition, the guidelines allow the use of \"unisex\" or \"family\" accessible toilet rooms in alterations when technical infeasibility can be demonstrated. Experience has shown that the provision of accessible \"unisex\" or single-user restrooms is a reasonable way to provide access for wheelchair users and any attendants, especially when attendants are of the opposite sex. Since these facilities have proven so useful, it is often considered advantageous to install a \"unisex\" toilet room in new facilities in addition to making the multi-stall restrooms accessible, especially in shopping malls, large auditoriums, and convention centers.\n\nFigure 28 (section 4.16) provides minimum clear floor space dimensions for toilets in accessible \"unisex\" toilet rooms. The dotted lines designate the minimum clear floor space, depending on the direction of approach, required for wheelchair users to transfer onto the water closet. The dimensions of 48 in (1220 mm) and 60 in (1525 mm), respectively, correspond to the space required for the two common transfer approaches utilized by wheelchair users (see Fig. A6). It is important to keep in mind that the placement of the lavatory to the immediate side of the water closet will preclude the side approach transfer illustrated in Figure A6(b). To accommodate the side transfer, the space adjacent to the water closet must remain clear of obstruction for 42 in (1065 mm) from the centerline of the toilet (Figure 28) and the lavatory must not be located within this clear space. A turning circle or T-turn, the clear floor space at the lavatory, and maneuvering space at the door must be considered when determining the possible wall locations. A privacy latch or other accessible means of ensuring privacy during use should be provided at the door.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n1. In new construction, accessible single-user restrooms may be desirable in some situations because they can accommodate a wide variety of building users. However, they cannot be used in lieu of making the multi-stall toilet rooms accessible as required.\n\n2. Where strict compliance to the guidelines for accessible toilet facilities is technically infeasible in the alteration of existing facilities, accessible \"unisex\" toilets are a reasonable alternative.\n\n3. In designing accessible single-user restrooms, the provisions of adequate space to allow a side transfer will provide accommodation to the largest number of wheelchair users.\n\nA4.23 Bathrooms, Bathing Facilities, and Shower Rooms.\n\nA4.23.3 Clear Floor Space. Figure A7 shows two possible configurations of a toilet room with a roll-in shower. The specific shower shown is designed to fit exactly within the dimensions of a standard bathtub. Since the shower does not have a lip, the floor space can be used for required maneuvering space. This would permit a toilet room to be smaller than would be permitted with a bathtub and still provide enough floor space to be considered accessible. This design can provide accessibility in facilities where space is at a premium (i.e., hotels and medical care facilities). The alternate roll-in shower (Fig. 57b) also provides sufficient room for the \"T-turn\" and does not require plumbing to be on more than one wall.\n\nA4.23.9 Medicine Cabinets. Other alternatives for storing medical and personal care items are very useful to disabled people. Shelves, drawers, and floor-mounted cabinets can be provided within the reach ranges of disabled people.\n\nA4.26 Handrails, Grab Bars, and Tub and Shower Seats.\n\nA4.26.1 General. Many disabled people rely heavily upon grab bars and handrails to maintain balance and prevent serious falls. Many people brace their forearms between supports and walls to give them more leverage and stability in maintaining balance or for lifting. The grab bar clearance of 1-1/2 in (38 mm) required in this guideline is a safety clearance to prevent injuries resulting from arms slipping through the openings. It also provides adequate gripping room.\n\nA4.26.2 Size and Spacing of Grab Bars and Handrails. This specification allows for alternate shapes of handrails as long as they allow an opposing grip similar to that provided by a circular section of 1-1/4 in to 1-1/2 in (32 mm to 38 mm).\n\nA4.27 Controls and Operating Mechanisms.\n\nA4.27.3 Height. Fig. A8 further illustrates mandatory and advisory control mounting height provisions for typical equipment.\n\nElectrical receptacles installed to serve individual appliances and not intended for regular or frequent use by building occupants are not required to be mounted within the specified reach ranges. Examples would be receptacles installed specifically for wall-mounted clocks, refrigerators, and microwave ovens.\n\nA4.28 Alarms.",

    "content": "A4.28 Alarms.\n\nA4.28.2 Audible Alarms. Audible emergency signals must have an intensity and frequency that can attract the attention of individuals who have partial hearing loss. People over 60 years of age generally have difficulty perceiving frequencies higher than 10,000 Hz. An alarm signal which has a periodic element to its signal, such as single stroke bells (clang-pause-clang- pause), hi-low (up-down-up-down) and fast whoop (on-off-on-off) are best. Avoid continuous or reverberating tones. Select a signal which has a sound characterized by three or four clear tones without a great deal of \"noise\" in between.\n\nA4.28.3 Visual Alarms. The specifications in this section do not preclude the use of zoned or coded alarm systems.\n\nA4.28.4 Auxiliary Alarms. Locating visual emergency alarms in rooms where persons who are deaf may work or reside alone can ensure that they will always be warned when an emergency alarm is activated. To be effective, such devices must be located and oriented so that they will spread signals and reflections throughout a space or raise the overall light level sharply. However, visual alarms alone are not necessarily the best means to alert sleepers. A study conducted by Underwriters Laboratory (UL) concluded that a flashing light more than seven times brighter was required (110 candela v. 15 candela, at the same distance) to awaken sleepers as was needed to alert awake subjects in a normal daytime illuminated room.\n\nFor hotel and other rooms where people are likely to be asleep, a signal-activated vibrator placed between mattress and box spring or under a pillow was found by UL to be much more effective in alerting sleepers. Many readily available devices are sound-activated so that they could respond to an alarm clock, clock radio, wake-up telephone call or room smoke detector. Activation by a building alarm system can either be accomplished by a separate circuit activating an auditory alarm which would, in turn, trigger the vibrator or by a signal transmitted through the ordinary 110-volt outlet. Transmission of signals through the power line is relatively simple and is the basis of common, inexpensive remote light control systems sold in many department and electronic stores for home use. So-called \"wireless\" intercoms operate on the same principal.\n\nA4.29 Detectable Warnings.\n\nA4.29.2 Detectable Warnings on Walking Surfaces. The material used to provide contrast should contrast by at least 70%.\n\nContrast in percent is determined by:\n\nContrast = [(B1 - B2)/B1] x 100\n\nwhere B1 = light reflectance value (LRV) of the lighter area and B2 = light reflectance value (LRV) of the darker area.\n\nNote that in any application both white and black are never absolute; thus, B1 never equals 100 and B2 is always greater than 0.\n\nA4.30 Signage.\n\nA4.30.1 General. In building complexes where finding locations independently on a routine basis may be a necessity (for example, college campuses), tactile maps or prerecorded instructions can be very helpful to visually impaired people. Several maps and auditory instructions have been developed and tested for specific applications. The type of map or instructions used must be based on the information to be communicated, which depends highly on the type of buildings or users.\n\nLandmarks that can easily be distinguished by visually impaired individuals are useful as orientation cues. Such cues include changes in illumination level, bright colors, unique patterns, wall murals, location of special equipment or other architectural features.\n\nMany people with disabilities have limitations in movement of their heads and reduced peripheral vision. Thus, signage positioned perpendicular to the path of travel is easiest for them to notice. People can generally distinguish signage within an angle of 30 degrees to either side of the centerlines of their faces without moving their heads.\n\nA4.30.2 Character Proportion. The legibility of printed characters is a function of the viewing distance, character height, the ratio of the stroke width to the height of the character, the contrast of color between character and background, and print font. The size of characters must be based upon the intended viewing distance. A severely nearsighted person may have to be much closer to recognize a character of a given size than a person with normal visual acuity.\n\nA4.30.4 Raised and Brailled Characters and Pictorial Symbol Signs (Pictograms). The standard dimensions for literary Braille are as follows:\n\nDot diameter .059 in.\n\nInter-dot spacing .090 in.\n\nHorizontal separation between cells .241 in.\n\nVertical separation between cells .395 in.\n\nRaised borders around signs containing raised characters may make them confusing to read unless the border is set far away from the characters. Accessible signage with descriptive materials about public buildings, monuments, and objects of cultural interest may not provide sufficiently detailed and meaningful information. Interpretive guides, audio tape devices, or other methods may be more effective in presenting such information.\n\nA4.30.5 Finish and Contrast. An eggshell finish (11 to 19 degree gloss on 60 degree glossimeter) is recommended. Research indicates that signs are more legible for persons with low vision when characters contrast with their background by at least 70 percent. Contrast in percent shall be determined by:\n\nContrast = [(B1 - B2)/B1] x 100\n\nwhere B1 = light reflectance value (LRV) of the lighter area and B2 = light reflectance value (LRV) of the darker area.\n\nNote that in any application both white and black are never absolute; thus, B1 never equals 100 and B2 is always greater than 0.\n\nThe greatest readability is usually achieved through the use of light-colored characters or symbols on a dark background.\n\nA4.30.7 Symbols of Accessibility for Different Types of Listening Systems. Paragraph 4 of this section requires signage indicating the availability of an assistive listening system. An appropriate message should be displayed with the international symbol of access for hearing loss since this symbol conveys general accessibility for people with hearing loss.

The operator button is located at a height of 46 in (1170 mm) if the coin slot of the telephone is at 54 in (1370 mm). A generally available public telephone with a coin slot mounted lower on the equipment would allow universal installation of telephones at a height of 48 in (1220 mm) or less to all operable parts.",

A public text telephone may be an integrated text telephone pay phone unit or a conventional portable text telephone that is permanently affixed within, or adjacent to, the telephone enclosure. In order to be usable with a pay phone, a text telephone which is not a single integrated text telephone pay phone unit will require a shelf large enough (10 in (255mm) wide by 10 in (255 mm) deep with a 6 in (150 mm) vertical clearance minimum) to accommodate the device, an electrical outlet, and a power cord. Movable or portable text telephones may be used to provide equivalent facilitation. A text telephone should be readily available so that a person using it may access the text telephone easily and conveniently. As currently designed pocket-type text telephones for personal use do not accommodate a wide range of users. Such devices would not be considered substantially equivalent to conventional text telephones. However, in the future as technology develops this could change.\n\nA4.32 Fixed or Built-in Seating and Tables.\n\nA4.32.4 Height of Tables or Counters. Different types of work require different table or counter heights for comfort and optimal performance. Light detailed work such as writing requires a table or counter close to elbow height for a standing person. Heavy manual work such as rolling dough requires a counter or table height about 10 in (255 mm) below elbow height for a standing person. This principle of high/low table or counter heights also applies for seated persons; however, the limiting condition for seated manual work is clearance under the table or counter.\n\nTable A1 shows convenient counter heights for seated persons. The great variety of heights for comfort and optimal performance indicates a need for alternatives or a compromise in height if people who stand and people who sit will be using the same counter area.\n\nTABLE A1 CONVENIENT HEIGHTS OF TABLES AND COUNTERS FOR SEATED PEOPLE1\n\nCONDITIONS OF USE\nSHORT WOMEN\nTALL MEN\n\nSeated in a wheelchair:\nManual work-\nDesk or removable armrests\n\nFixed, full-size armrests2\nLight, detailed work:\nDesk or removable armrests\n\nFixed, full-size armrests2\nSeated in a 16 in (405 mm)\nHigh chair:\nManual work\n\nLight, detailed work\t28\t710\t31\t785\n\n1All dimensions are based on a work-surface thickness of 1 1/2 in (38 mm) and a clearance of 1 1/2 in (38 mm) between legs and the underside of a work surface.\n\n2This type of wheelchair arm does not interfere with the positioning of a wheelchair under a work surface.\n\n3This dimension is limited by the height of the armrests: a lower height would be preferable. Some people in this group prefer lower work surfaces, which require positioning the wheelchair back from the edge of the counter.\n\nA4.33 Assembly Areas.\n\nA4.33.2 Size of Wheelchair Locations. Spaces large enough for two wheelchairs allow people who are coming to a performance together to sit together.\n\nA4.33.3 Placement of Wheelchair Locations. The location of wheelchair areas can be planned so that a variety of positions within the seating area are provided. This will allow choice in viewing and price categories.\n\nBuilding/life safety codes set minimum distances between rows of fixed seats with consideration of the number of seats in a row, the exit aisle width and arrangement, and the location of exit doors. \"Continental\" seating, with a greater number of seats per row and a commensurate increase in row spacing and exit doors, facilitates emergency egress for all people and increases ease of access to mid-row seats especially for people who walk with difficulty. Consideration of this positive attribute of \"continental\" seating should be included along with all other factors in the design of fixed seating areas.\n\nA4.33.6 Placement of Listening Systems. A distance of 50 ft (15 m) allows a person to distinguish performers' facial expressions.\n\nA4.33.7 Types of Listening Systems. An assistive listening system appropriate for an assembly area for a group of persons or where the specific individuals are not known in advance, such as a playhouse, lecture hall or movie theater, may be different from the system appropriate for a particular individual provided as an auxiliary aid or as part of a reasonable accommodation. The appropriate device for an individual is the type that individual can use, whereas the appropriate system for an assembly area will necessarily be geared toward the \"average\" or aggregate needs of various individuals. A listening system that can be used from any seat in a seating area is the most flexible way to meet this specification. Earphone jacks with variable volume controls can benefit only people who have slight hearing loss and do not help people who use hearing aids. At the present time, magnetic induction loops are the most feasible type of listening system for people who use hearing aids equipped with \"T-coils,\" but people without hearing aids or those with hearing aids not equipped with inductive pick-ups cannot use them without special receivers. Radio frequency systems can be extremely effective and inexpensive. People without hearing aids can use them, but people with hearing aids need a special receiver to use them as they are presently designed. If hearing aids had a jack to allow a by-pass of microphones, then radio frequency systems would be suitable for people with and without hearing aids. Some listening systems may be subject to interference from other equipment and feedback from hearing aids of people who are using the systems. Such interference can be controlled by careful engineering design that anticipates feedback sources in the surrounding area.\n\nTable A2, reprinted from a National Institute of Disability and Rehabilitation Research \"Rehab Brief,\" shows some of the advantages and disadvantages of different types of assistive listening systems. In addition, the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) has published a pamphlet on Assistive Listening Systems which lists demonstration centers across the country where technical assistance can be obtained in selecting and installing appropriate systems. The state of New York has also adopted a detailed technical specification which may be useful.\n\nTable A2.

Dining counters (where there is no service) are typically found in small carry-out restaurants, bakeries, or coffee shops and may only be a narrow eating surface attached to a wall. This section requires that where such a dining counter is provided, a portion of the counter shall be at the required accessible height.\n\nA7.0 Business and Mercantile.\n\nA7.2(3) Assistive Listening Devices. At all sales and service counters, teller windows, box offices, and information kiosks where a physical barrier separates service personnel and customers, it is recommended that at least one permanently installed assistive listening device complying with 4.33 be provided at each location or series. Where assistive listening devices are installed, signage should be provided identifying those stations which are so equipped.\n\nA7.3 Check-out Aisles. Section 7.2 refers to counters without aisles; section 7.3 concerns check-out aisles. A counter without an aisle (7.2) can be approached from more than one direction such as in a convenience store. In order to use a check-out aisle (7.3), customers must enter a defined area (an aisle) at a particular point, pay for goods, and exit at a particular point.\n\nA10.3 Fixed Facilities and Stations\n\nA10.3.1(7) Route Signs. One means of making control buttons on fare vending machines usable by persons with vision impairments is to raise them above the surrounding surface. Those activated by a mechanical motion are likely to be more detectable. If farecard vending, collection, and adjustment devices are designed to accommodate farecards having one tactually distinctive corner, then a person who has a vision impairment will insert the card with greater ease. Token collection devices that are designed to accommodate tokens which are perforated can allow a person to distinguish more readily between tokens and common coins. Thoughtful placement of accessible gates and fare vending machines in relation to inaccessible devices will make their use and detection easier for all persons with disabilities.\n\n[56 FR 35592, 1991-07-26, as amended by Order No. 1679-93, 58 FR 17522, Apr. 5, 1993; Order No. 1836-94, 59 FR 2675, Jan. 18, 1994]\n\nPt. 36, App. B\n\nAppendix B to Part 36 -- Preamble to Regulation on Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability by Public Accommodations and in Commercial Facilities (Published 1991-07-26)\n\nNote: For the convenience of the reader, this appendix contains the text of the preamble to the final regulation on nondiscrimination on the basis of disability by public accommodations and in commercial facilities beginning at the heading \"Section-by-Section Analysis and Response to Comments'' and ending before \"List of Subjects in 28 CFR part 36'' (56 FR 35546, 1991-07-26).\n\nSection-By-Section Analysis and Response to Comments\n\nSubpart A -- General\n\nSection 36.101 Purpose\n\nSection 36.101 states the purpose of the rule, which is to effectuate title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. This title prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by public accommodations, requires places of public accommodation and commercial facilities to be designed, constructed, and altered in compliance with the accessibility standards established by this part, and requires that examinations or courses related to licensing or certification for professional or trade purposes be accessible to persons with disabilities.\n\nSection 36.102 Application\n\nSection 36.102 specifies the range of entities and facilities that have obligations under the final rule. The rule applies to any public accommodation or commercial facility as those terms are defined in Sec.36.\n\n104. It also applies, in accordance with section 309 of the ADA, to private entities that offer examinations or courses related to applications, licensing, certification, or credentialing for secondary or postsecondary education, professional, or trade purposes. Except as provided in Sec.36.206, \"Retaliation or coercion,'' this part does not apply to individuals other than public accommodations or to public entities. Coverage of private individuals and public entities is discussed in the preamble to Sec.36.\n\n206. As defined in Sec.36.104, a public accommodation is a private entity that owns, leases or leases to, or operates a place of public accommodation. Section 36.102(b)(2) emphasizes that the general and specific public accommodations requirements of subparts B and C obligate a public accommodation only with respect to the operations of a place of public accommodation. This distinction is drawn in recognition of the fact that a private entity that meets the regulatory definition of public accommodation could also own, lease or lease to, or operate facilities that are not places of public accommodation. The rule would exceed the reach of the ADA if it were to apply the public accommodations requirements of subparts B and C to the operations of a private entity that do not involve a place of public accommodation. Similarly, Sec.36.102(b)(3) provides that the new construction and alterations requirements of subpart D obligate a public accommodation only with respect to facilities used as, or designed or constructed for use as, places of public accommodation or commercial facilities.\n\nOn the other hand, as mandated by the ADA and reflected in Sec.36.102(c), the new construction and alterations requirements of subpart D apply to a commercial facility whether or not the facility is a place of public accommodation, or is owned, leased, leased to, or operated by a public accommodation.\n\nSection 36.102(e) states that the rule does not apply to any private club, religious entity, or public entity. Each of these terms is defined in Sec.36.\n\n104. The exclusion of private clubs and religious entities is derived from section 307 of the ADA; and the exclusion of public entities is based on the statutory definition of public accommodation in section 301(7) of the ADA, which excludes entities other than private entities from coverage under title III of the ADA.\n\nSection 36.103 Relationship to Other Laws",

    "content": "Section 36.103 Relationship to Other Laws\n\nSection 36.103 is derived from sections 501 (a) and (b) of the ADA. Paragraph (a) provides that, except as otherwise specifically provided by this part, the ADA is not intended to apply lesser standards than are required under title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 790 - 794), or the regulations implementing that title. The standards of title V of the Rehabilitation Act apply for purposes of the ADA to the extent that the ADA has not explicitly adopted a different standard from title V. Where the ADA explicitly provides a different standard from section 504, the ADA standard applies to the ADA, but not to section 504. For example, section 504 requires that all federally assisted programs and activities be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps, even if major structural alterations are necessary to make a program accessible. Title III of the ADA, in contrast, only requires alterations to existing facilities if the modifications are \"readily achievable,'' that is, able to be accomplished easily and without much difficulty or expense. A public accommodation that is covered under both section 504 and the ADA is still required to meet the \"program accessibility'' standard in order to comply with section 504, but would not be in violation of the ADA unless it failed to make \"readily achievable'' modifications. On the other hand, an entity covered by the ADA is required to make \"readily achievable'' modifications, even if the program can be made accessible without any architectural modifications. Thus, an entity covered by both section 504 and title III of the ADA must meet both the \"program accessibility'' requirement and the \"readily achievable'' requirement.\n\nParagraph (b) makes explicit that the rule does not affect the obligation of recipients of Federal financial assistance to comply with the requirements imposed under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n\nParagraph (c) makes clear that Congress did not intend to displace any of the rights or remedies provided by other Federal laws or other State or local laws (including State common law) that provide greater or equal protection to individuals with disabilities. A plaintiff may choose to pursue claims under a State law that does not confer greater substantive rights, or even confers fewer substantive rights, if the alleged violation is protected under the alternative law and the remedies are greater. For example, assume that a person with a physical disability seeks damages under a State law that allows compensatory and punitive damages for discrimination on the basis of physical disability, but does not allow them on the basis of mental disability. In that situation, the State law would provide narrower coverage, by excluding mental disabilities, but broader remedies, and an individual covered by both laws could choose to bring an action under both laws. Moreover, State tort claims confer greater remedies and are not preempted by the ADA. A plaintiff may join a State tort claim to a case brought under the ADA. In such a case, the plaintiff must, of course, prove all the elements of the State tort claim in order to prevail under that cause of action.\n\nSection 36.104 Definitions\n\n\"Act.'' The word \"Act'' is used in the regulation to refer to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101 - 336, which is also referred to as the \"ADA.''\n\n\"Commerce.'' The definition of \"commerce'' is identical to the statutory definition provided in section 301(l) of the ADA. It means travel, trade, traffic, commerce, transportation, or communication among the several States, between any foreign country or any territory or possession and any State, or between points in the same State but through another State or foreign country. Commerce is defined in the same manner as in title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits racial discrimination in public accommodations.\n\nThe term \"commerce'' is used in the definition of \"place of public accommodation.'' According to that definition, one of the criteria that an entity must meet before it can be considered a place of public accommodation is that its operations affect commerce. The term \"commerce'' is similarly used in the definition of \"commercial facility.''\n\nThe use of the phrase \"operations affect commerce'' applies the full scope of coverage of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution in enforcing the ADA. The Constitution gives Congress broad authority to regulate interstate commerce, including the activities of local business enterprises (e.g., a physician's office, a neighborhood restaurant, a laundromat, or a bakery) that affect interstate commerce through the purchase or sale of products manufactured in other States, or by providing services to individuals from other States. Because of the integrated nature of the national economy, the ADA and this final rule will have extremely broad application.\n\n\"Commercial facilities'' are those facilities that are intended for nonresidential use by a private entity and whose operations affect commerce. As explained under Sec.36.401, \"New construction,'' the new construction and alteration requirements of subpart D of the rule apply to all commercial facilities, whether or not they are places of public accommodation. Those commercial facilities that are not places of public accommodation are not subject to the requirements of subparts B and C (e.g., those requirements concerning auxiliary aids and general nondiscrimination provisions).\n\nCongress recognized that the employees within commercial facilities would generally be protected under title I (employment) of the Act. However, as the House Committee on Education and Labor pointed out, \"[t]o the extent that new facilities are built in a manner that make[s] them accessible to all individuals, including potential employees, there will be less of a need for individual employers to engage in reasonable accommodations for particular employees.'' H.R. Rep. No. 485, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, at 117 (1990) [hereinafter \"Education and Labor report'']. While employers of fewer than 15 employees are not covered by title I's employment discrimination provisions, there is no such limitation with respect to new construction covered under title III. Congress chose not to so limit the new construction provisions because of its desire for a uniform requirement of accessibility in new construction, because accessibility can be accomplished easily in the design and construction stage, and because future expansion of a business or sale or lease of the property to a larger employer or to a business that is a place of public accommodation is always a possibility.\n\nThe term \"commercial facilities'' is not intended to be defined by dictionary or common industry definitions. Included in this category are factories, warehouses, office buildings, and other buildings in which employment may occur. The phrase, \"whose operations affect commerce,'' is to be read broadly, to include all types of activities reached under the commerce clause of the Constitution.",

    "content": "The phrase, \"whose operations affect commerce,'' is to be read broadly, to include all types of activities reached under the commerce clause of the Constitution.\n\nPrivately operated airports are also included in the category of commercial facilities. They are not, however, places of public accommodation because they are not terminals used for \"specified public transportation.'' (Transportation by aircraft is specifically excluded from the statutory definition of \"specified public transportation.'') Thus, privately operated airports are subject to the new construction and alteration requirements of this rule (subpart D) but not to subparts B and C. (Airports operated by public entities are covered by title II of the Act.) Places of public accommodation located within airports, such as restaurants, shops, lounges, or conference centers, however, are covered by subparts B and C of this part.\n\nThe statute's definition of \"commercial facilities'' specifically includes only facilities \"that are intended for nonresidential use'' and specifically exempts those facilities that are covered or expressly exempted from coverage under the Fair Housing Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 3601 - 3631). The interplay between the Fair Housing Act and the ADA with respect to those facilities that are \"places of public accommodation'' was the subject of many comments and is addressed in the preamble discussion of the definition of \"place of public accommodation.''\n\n\"Current illegal use of drugs.'' The phrase \"current illegal use of drugs'' is used in Sec.36.\n\n209. Its meaning is discussed in the preamble for that section.\n\n\"Disability.'' The definition of the term \"disability'' is comparable to the definition of the term \"individual with handicaps'' in section 7(8)(B) of the Rehabilitation Act and section 802(h) of the Fair Housing Act. The Education and Labor Committee report makes clear that the analysis of the term \"individual with handicaps'' by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in its regulations implementing section 504 (42 FR 22685 (1977-05-04)) and the analysis by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in its regulation implementing the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (54 FR 3232 (Jan. 23, 1989)) should also apply fully to the term \"disability'' (Education and Labor report at 50).\n\nThe use of the term \"disability'' instead of \"handicap'' and the term \"individual with a disability'' instead of \"individual with handicaps'' represents an effort by the Congress to make use of up-to-date, currently accepted terminology. The terminology applied to individuals with disabilities is a very significant and sensitive issue. As with racial and ethnic terms, the choice of words to describe a person with a disability is overlaid with stereotypes, patronizing attitudes, and other emotional connotations. Many individuals with disabilities, and organizations representing such individuals, object to the use of such terms as \"handicapped person'' or \"the handicapped.'' In other recent legislation, Congress also recognized this shift in terminology, e.g., by changing the name of the National Council on the Handicapped to the National Council on Disability (Pub. L. 100 - 630).\n\nIn enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act, Congress concluded that it was important for the current legislation to use terminology most in line with the sensibilities of most Americans with disabilities. No change in definition or substance is intended nor should be attributed to this change in phraseology.\n\nThe term \"disability'' means, with respect to an individual --\n\n(A) A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual;\n\n(B) A record of such an impairment; or\n\n(C) Being regarded as having such an impairment.\n\nIf an individual meets any one of these three tests, he or she is considered to be an individual with a disability for purposes of coverage under the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nCongress adopted this same basic definition of \"disability,'' first used in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and in the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, for a number of reasons. It has worked well since it was adopted in 1974. There is a substantial body of administrative interpretation and judicial precedent on this definition. Finally, it would not be possible to guarantee comprehensiveness by providing a list of specific disabilities, especially because new disorders may be recognized in the future, as they have since the definition was first established in 1974.\n\nTest A -- A Physical or Mental Impairment That Substantially Limits One or More of the Major Life Activities of Such Individual\n\nPhysical or mental impairment. Under the first test, an individual must have a physical or mental impairment. As explained in paragraph (1) (i) of the definition, \"impairment'' means any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following body systems: Neurological; musculoskeletal; special sense organs (including speech organs that are not respiratory, such as vocal cords, soft palate, and tongue); respiratory, including speech organs; cardiovascular; reproductive; digestive; genitourinary; hemic and lymphatic; skin; and endocrine. It also means any mental or psychological disorder, such as mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities. This list closely tracks the one used in the regulations for section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (see, e.g., 45 CFR 84.3(j)(2)(i)).\n\nMany commenters asked that \"traumatic brain injury'' be added to the list in paragraph (1)(i). Traumatic brain injury is already included because it is a physiological condition affecting one of the listed body systems, i.e., \"neurological.'' Therefore, it was unnecessary for the Department to add the term to the regulation.\n\nIt is not possible to include a list of all the specific conditions, contagious and noncontagious diseases, or infections that would constitute physical or mental impairments because of the difficulty of ensuring the comprehensiveness of such a list, particularly in light of the fact that other conditions or disorders may be identified in the future. However, the list of examples in paragraph (1)(iii) of the definition includes: Orthopedic, visual, speech and hearing impairments; cerebral palsy; epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, mental retardation, emotional illness, specific learning disabilities, HIV disease (symptomatic or asymptomatic), tuberculosis, drug addiction, and alcoholism.",

    "content": "However, the list of examples in paragraph (1)(iii) of the definition includes: Orthopedic, visual, speech and hearing impairments; cerebral palsy; epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, mental retardation, emotional illness, specific learning disabilities, HIV disease (symptomatic or asymptomatic), tuberculosis, drug addiction, and alcoholism.\n\nThe examples of \"physical or mental impairments'' in paragraph (1)(iii) are the same as those contained in many section 504 regulations, except for the addition of the phrase \"contagious and noncontagious'' to describe the types of diseases and conditions included, and the addition of \"HIV disease (symptomatic or asymptomatic)'' and \"tuberculosis'' to the list of examples. These additions are based on the ADA committee reports, caselaw, and official legal opinions interpreting section 504. In School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273 (1987), a case involving an individual with tuberculosis, the Supreme Court held that people with contagious diseases are entitled to the protections afforded by section 504. Following the Arline decision, this Department's Office of Legal Counsel issued a legal opinion that concluded that symptomatic HIV disease is an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity; therefore it has been included in the definition of disability under this part. The opinion also concluded that asymptomatic HIV disease is an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, either because of its actual effect on the individual with HIV disease or because the reactions of other people to individuals with HIV disease cause such individuals to be treated as though they are disabled. See Memorandum from Douglas W. Kmiec, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice, to Arthur B. Culvahouse, Jr., Counsel to the President (Sept. 27, 1988), reprinted in Hearings on S. 933, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Before the Subcomm. on the Handicapped of the Senate Comm. on Labor and Human Resources, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 346 (1989). The phrase \"symptomatic or asymptomatic'' was inserted in the final rule after \"HIV disease'' in response to commenters who suggested that the clarification was necessary to give full meaning to the Department's opinion.\n\nParagraph (1)(iv) of the definition states that the phrase \"physical or mental impairment'' does not include homosexuality or bisexuality. These conditions were never considered impairments under other Federal disability laws. Section 511(a) of the statute makes clear that they are likewise not to be considered impairments under the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nPhysical or mental impairment does not include simple physical characteristics, such as blue eyes or black hair. Nor does it include environmental, cultural, economic, or other disadvantages, such as having a prison record, or being poor. Nor is age a disability. Similarly, the definition does not include common personality traits such as poor judgment or a quick temper where these are not symptoms of a mental or psychological disorder. However, a person who has these characteristics and also has a physical or mental impairment may be considered as having a disability for purposes of the Americans with Disabilities Act based on the impairment.\n\nSubstantial limitation of a major life activity. Under Test A, the impairment must be one that \"substantially limits a major life activity.'' Major life activities include such things as caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working. For example, a person who is paraplegic is substantially limited in the major life activity of walking, a person who is blind is substantially limited in the major life activity of seeing, and a person who is mentally retarded is substantially limited in the major life activity of learning. A person with traumatic brain injury is substantially limited in the major life activities of caring for one's self, learning, and working because of memory deficit, confusion, contextual difficulties, and inability to reason appropriately.\n\nA person is considered an individual with a disability for purposes of Test A, the first prong of the definition, when the individual's important life activities are restricted as to the conditions, manner, or duration under which they can be performed in comparison to most people. A person with a minor, trivial impairment, such as a simple infected finger, is not impaired in a major life activity. A person who can walk for 10 miles continuously is not substantially limited in walking merely because, on the eleventh mile, he or she begins to experience pain, because most people would not be able to walk eleven miles without experiencing some discomfort.\n\nThe Department received many comments on the proposed rule's inclusion of the word \"temporary'' in the definition of \"disability.'' The preamble indicated that impairments are not necessarily excluded from the definition of \"disability'' simply because they are temporary, but that the duration, or expected duration, of an impairment is one factor that may properly be considered in determining whether the impairment substantially limits a major life activity. The preamble recognized, however, that temporary impairments, such as a broken leg, are not commonly regarded as disabilities, and only in rare circumstances would the degree of the limitation and its expected duration be substantial: Nevertheless, many commenters objected to inclusion of the word \"temporary'' both because it is not in the statute and because it is not contained in the definition of \"disability'' set forth in the title I regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The word \"temporary'' has been deleted from the final rule to conform with the statutory language. The question of whether a temporary impairment is a disability must be resolved on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration both the duration (or expected duration) of the impairment and the extent to which it actually limits a major life activity of the affected individual.\n\nThe question of whether a person has a disability should be assessed without regard to the availability of mitigating measures, such as reasonable modifications or auxiliary aids and services. For example, a person with hearing loss is substantially limited in the major life activity of hearing, even though the loss may be improved through the use of a hearing aid. Likewise, persons with impairments, such as epilepsy or diabetes, that substantially limit a major life activity, are covered under the first prong of the definition of disability, even if the effects of the impairment are controlled by medication.\n\nMany commenters asked that environmental illness (also known as multiple chemical sensitivity) as well as allergy to cigarette smoke be recognized as disabilities. The Department, however, declines to state categorically that these types of allergies or sensitivities are disabilities, because the determination as to whether an impairment is a disability depends on whether, given the particular circumstances at issue, the impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities (or has a history of, or is regarded as having such an effect).",

Such an individual would be entitled to all of the protections afforded by the Act and this part. In other cases, individuals may be sensitive to environmental elements or to smoke but their sensitivity will not rise to the level needed to constitute a disability. For example, their major life activity of breathing may be somewhat, but not substantially, impaired. In such circumstances, the individuals are not disabled and are not entitled to the protections of the statute despite their sensitivity to environmental agents.\n\nIn sum, the determination as to whether allergies to cigarette smoke, or allergies or sensitivities characterized by the commenters as environmental illness are disabilities covered by the regulation must be made using the same case-by-case analysis that is applied to all other physical or mental impairments. Moreover, the addition of specific regulatory provisions relating to environmental illness in the final rule would be inappropriate at this time pending future consideration of the issue by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the Department of Labor.\n\nTest B -- A Record of Such an Impairment\n\nThis test is intended to cover those who have a record of an impairment. As explained in paragraph (3) of the rule's definition of disability, this includes a person who has a history of an impairment that substantially limited a major life activity, such as someone who has recovered from an impairment. It also includes persons who have been misclassified as having an impairment.\n\nThis provision is included in the definition in part to protect individuals who have recovered from a physical or mental impairment that previously substantially limited them in a major life activity. Discrimination on the basis of such a past impairment is prohibited. Frequently occurring examples of the first group (those who have a history of an impairment) are persons with histories of mental or emotional illness, heart disease, or cancer; examples of the second group (those who have been misclassified as having an impairment) are persons who have been misclassified as having mental retardation or mental illness.\n\nTest C -- Being Regarded as Having Such an Impairment\n\nThis test, as contained in paragraph (4) of the definition, is intended to cover persons who are treated by a private entity or public accommodation as having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. It applies when a person is treated as if he or she has an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, regardless of whether that person has an impairment.\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act uses the same \"regarded as'' test set forth in the regulations implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. See, e.g., 28 CFR 42.540(k)(2)(iv), which provides:\n\n(iv) \"Is regarded as having an impairment'' means (A) Has a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit major life activities but that is treated by a recipient as constituting such a limitation; (B) Has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others toward such impairment; or (C) Has none of the impairments defined in paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section but is treated by a recipient as having such an impairment.\n\nThe perception of the private entity or public accommodation is a key element of this test. A person who perceives himself or herself to have an impairment, but does not have an impairment, and is not treated as if he or she has an impairment, is not protected under this test. A person would be covered under this test if a restaurant refused to serve that person because of a fear of \"negative reactions'' of others to that person. A person would also be covered if a public accommodation refused to serve a patron because it perceived that the patron had an impairment that limited his or her enjoyment of the goods or services being offered.\n\nFor example, persons with severe burns often encounter discrimination in community activities, resulting in substantial limitation of major life activities. These persons would be covered under this test based on the attitudes of others towards the impairment, even if they did not view themselves as \"impaired.''\n\nThe rationale for this third test, as used in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, was articulated by the Supreme Court in Arline, 480 U.S. 273 (1987). The Court noted that, although an individual may have an impairment that does not in fact substantially limit a major life activity, the reaction of others may prove just as disabling. \"Such an impairment might not diminish a person's physical or mental capabilities, but could nevertheless substantially limit that person's ability to work as a result of the negative reactions of others to the impairment.'' Id. at 283. The Court concluded that, by including this test in the Rehabilitation Act's definition, \"Congress acknowledged that society's accumulated myths and fears about disability and disease are as handicapping as are the physical limitations that flow from actual impairment.'' Id. at 284.\n\nThus, a person who is not allowed into a public accommodation because of the myths, fears, and stereotypes associated with disabilities would be covered under this third test whether or not the person's physical or mental condition would be considered a disability under the first or second test in the definition.\n\nIf a person is refused admittance on the basis of an actual or perceived physical or mental condition, and the public accommodation can articulate no legitimate reason for the refusal (such as failure to meet eligibility criteria), a perceived concern about admitting persons with disabilities could be inferred and the individual would qualify for coverage under the \"regarded as'' test. A person who is covered because of being regarded as having an impairment is not required to show that the public accommodation's perception is inaccurate (e.g., that he will be accepted by others, or that insurance rates will not increase) in order to be admitted to the public accommodation.",

The excluded conditions are: transvestism, transsexualism, pedophilia, exhibitionism, voyeurism, gender identity disorders not resulting from physical impairments, other sexual behavior disorders, compulsive gambling, kleptomania, pyromania, and psychoactive substance use disorders resulting from current illegal use of drugs. Unlike homosexuality and bisexuality, which are not considered impairments under either the Americans with Disabilities Act (see the definition of \"disability,'' paragraph (1)(iv)) or section 504, the conditions listed in paragraph (5), except for transvestism, are not necessarily excluded as impairments under section 504. (Transvestism was excluded from the definition of disability for section 504 by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100 - 430, Sec.6(b).) The phrase \"current illegal use of drugs'' used in this definition is explained in the preamble to Sec.36.\n\n209. \"Drug.'' The definition of the term \"drug'' is taken from section 510(d)(2) of the ADA.\n\n\"Facility.'' \"Facility'' means all or any portion of buildings, structures, sites, complexes, equipment, rolling stock or other conveyances, roads, walks, passageways, parking lots, or other real or personal property, including the site where the building, property, structure, or equipment is located. Committee reports made clear that the definition of facility was drawn from the definition of facility in current Federal regulations (see, e.g., Education and Labor report at 114). It includes both indoor and outdoor areas where human-constructed improvements, structures, equipment, or property have been added to the natural environment.\n\nThe term \"rolling stock or other conveyances'' was not included in the definition of facility in the proposed rule. However, commenters raised questions about the applicability of this part to places of public accommodation operated in mobile facilities (such as cruise ships, floating restaurants, or mobile health units). Those places of public accommodation are covered under this part, and would be included in the definition of \"facility.'' Thus the requirements of subparts B and C would apply to those places of public accommodation. For example, a covered entity could not discriminate on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the facilities (Sec.36.201). Similarly, a cruise line could not apply eligibility criteria to potential passengers in a manner that would screen out individuals with disabilities, unless the criteria are \"necessary,'' as provided in Sec.36.\n\n301. However, standards for new construction and alterations of such facilities are not yet included in the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG) adopted by Sec.36.406 and incorporated in appendix A. The Department therefore will not interpret the new construction and alterations provisions of subpart D to apply to the types of facilities discussed here, pending further development of specific requirements.\n\nRequirements pertaining to accessible transportation services provided by public accommodations are included in Sec.36.310 of this part; standards pertaining to accessible vehicles will be issued by the Secretary of Transportation pursuant to section 306 of the Act, and will be codified at 49 CFR part 37.\n\nA public accommodation has obligations under this rule with respect to a cruise ship to the extent that its operations are subject to the laws of the United States.\n\nThe definition of \"facility'' only includes the site over which the private entity may exercise control or on which a place of public accommodation or a commercial facility is located. It does not include, for example, adjacent roads or walks controlled by a public entity that is not subject to this part. Public entities are subject to the requirements of title II of the Act. The Department's regulation implementing title II, which will be codified at 28 CFR part 35, addresses the obligations of public entities to ensure accessibility by providing curb ramps at pedestrian walkways.\n\n\"Illegal use of drugs.'' The definition of \"illegal use of drugs'' is taken from section 510(d)(1) of the Act and clarifies that the term includes the illegal use of one or more drugs.\n\n\"Individual with a disability'' means a person who has a disability but does not include an individual who is currently illegally using drugs, when the public accommodation acts on the basis of such use. The phrase \"current illegal use of drugs'' is explained in the preamble to Sec.36.\n\n209. \"Place of public accommodation.'' The term \"place of public accommodation'' is an adaptation of the statutory definition of \"public accommodation'' in section 301(7) of the ADA and appears as an element of the regulatory definition of public accommodation. The final rule defines \"place of public accommodation'' as a facility, operated by a private entity, whose operations affect commerce and fall within at least one of 12 specified categories. The term \"public accommodation,'' on the other hand, is reserved by the final rule for the private entity that owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation. It is the public accommodation, and not the place of public accommodation, that is subject to the regulation's nondiscrimination requirements. Placing the obligation not to discriminate on the public accommodation, as defined in the rule, is consistent with section 302(a) of the ADA, which places the obligation not to discriminate on any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.\n\nFacilities operated by government agencies or other public entities as defined in this section do not qualify as places of public accommodation. The actions of public entities are governed by title II of the ADA and will be subject to regulations issued by the Department of Justice under that title. The receipt of government assistance by a private entity does not by itself preclude a facility from being considered as a place of public accommodation.\n\nThe definition of place of public accommodation incorporates the 12 categories of facilities represented in the statutory definition of public accommodation in section 301(7) of the ADA:\n\n1. Places of lodging.\n\n2. Establishments serving food or drink.\n\n3. Places of exhibition or entertainment.\n\n4. Places of public gathering.\n\n5. Sales or rental establishments.\n\n6. Service establishments.\n\n7. Stations used for specified public transportation.\n\n8. Places of public display or collection.\n\n9. Places of recreation.\n\n10. Places of education.\n\n11. Social service center establishments.\n\n12. Places of exercise or recreation.",

    "content": "12. Places of exercise or recreation.\n\nIn order to be a place of public accommodation, a facility must be operated by a private entity, its operations must affect commerce, and it must fall within one of these 12 categories. While the list of categories is exhaustive, the representative examples of facilities within each category are not. Within each category only a few examples are given. The category of social service center establishments would include not only the types of establishments listed, day care centers, senior citizen centers, homeless shelters, food banks, adoption agencies, but also establishments such as substance abuse treatment centers, rape crisis centers, and halfway houses. As another example, the category of sales or rental establishments would include an innumerable array of facilities that would sweep far beyond the few examples given in the regulation. For example, other retail or wholesale establishments selling or renting items, such as bookstores, videotape rental stores, car rental establishment, pet stores, and jewelry stores would also be covered under this category, even though they are not specifically listed.\n\nSeveral commenters requested clarification as to the coverage of wholesale establishments under the category of \"sales or rental establishments.'' The Department intends for wholesale establishments to be covered under this category as places of public accommodation except in cases where they sell exclusively to other businesses and not to individuals. For example, a company that grows food produce and supplies its crops exclusively to food processing corporations on a wholesale basis does not become a public accommodation because of these transactions. If this company operates a road side stand where its crops are sold to the public, the road side stand would be a sales establishment covered by the ADA. Conversely, a sales establishment that markets its goods as \"wholesale to the public'' and sells to individuals would not be exempt from ADA coverage despite its use of the word \"wholesale'' as a marketing technique.\n\nOf course, a company that operates a place of public accommodation is subject to this part only in the operation of that place of public accommodation. In the example given above, the wholesale produce company that operates a road side stand would be a public accommodation only for the purposes of the operation of that stand. The company would be prohibited from discriminating on the basis of disability in the operation of the road side stand, and it would be required to remove barriers to physical access to the extent that it is readily achievable to do so (see Sec.36.304); however, in the event that it is not readily achievable to remove barriers, for example, by replacing a gravel surface or regrading the area around the stand to permit access by persons with mobility impairments, the company could meet its obligations through alternative methods of making its goods available, such as delivering produce to a customer in his or her car (see Sec.36.305). The concepts of readily achievable barrier removal and alternatives to barrier removal are discussed further in the preamble discussion of Sec..36.304 and 36.\n\n305. Even if a facility does not fall within one of the 12 categories, and therefore does not qualify as a place of public accommodation, it still may be a commercial facility as defined in Sec.36.104 and be subject to the new construction and alterations requirements of subpart D.\n\nA number of commenters questioned the treatment of residential hotels and other residential facilities in the Department's proposed rule. These commenters were essentially seeking resolution of the relationship between the Fair Housing Act and the ADA concerning facilities that are both residential in nature and engage in activities that would cause them to be classified as \"places of public accommodation'' under the ADA. The ADA's express exemption relating to the Fair Housing Act applies only to \"commercial facilities'' and not to \"places of public accommodation.''\n\nA facility whose operations affect interstate commerce is a place of public accommodation for purposes of the ADA to the extent that its operations include those types of activities engaged in or services provided by the facilities contained on the list of 12 categories in section 301(7) of the ADA. Thus, a facility that provides social services would be considered a \"social service center establishment.'' Similarly, the category \"places of lodging'' would exclude solely residential facilities because the nature of a place of lodging contemplates the use of the facility for short-term stays.\n\nMany facilities, however, are mixed use facilities. For example, in a large hotel that has a separate residential apartment wing, the residential wing would not be covered by the ADA because of the nature of the occupancy of that part of the facility. This residential wing would, however, be covered by the Fair Housing Act. The separate nonresidential accommodations in the rest of the hotel would be a place of lodging, and thus a public accommodation subject to the requirements of this final rule. If a hotel allows both residential and short-term stays, but does not allocate space for these different uses in separate, discrete units, both the ADA and the Fair Housing Act may apply to the facility. Such determinations will need to be made on a case-by-case basis. Any place of lodging of the type described in paragraph (1) of the definition of place of public accommodation and that is an establishment located within a building that contains not more than five rooms for rent or hire and is actually occupied by the proprietor of the establishment as his or her residence is not covered by the ADA. (This exclusion from coverage does not apply to other categories of public accommodations, for example, professional offices or homeless shelters, that are located in a building that is also occupied as a private residence.)\n\nA number of commenters noted that the term \"residential hotel'' may also apply to a type of hotel commonly known as a \"single room occupancy hotel.'' Although such hotels or portions of such hotels may fall under the Fair Housing Act when operated or used as long-term residences, they are also considered \"places of lodging'' under the ADA when guests of such hotels are free to use them on a short-term basis. In addition, \"single room occupancy hotels'' may provide social services to their guests, often through the operation of Federal or State grant programs. In such a situation, the facility would be considered a \"social service center establishment'' and thus covered by the ADA as a place of public accommodation, regardless of the length of stay of the occupants.",

Such facilities should be analyzed under the Fair Housing Act to determine the application of that statute. The ADA, however, requires a separate and independent analysis. For example, if the facility, or a portion of the facility, is intended for or permits short-term stays, or if it can appropriately be categorized as a service establishment or as a social service establishment, then the facility or that portion of the facility used for the covered purpose is a place of public accommodation under the ADA. For example, a homeless shelter that is intended and used only for long-term residential stays and that does not provide social services to its residents would not be covered as a place of public accommodation. However, if this facility permitted short-term stays or provided social services to its residents, it would be covered under the ADA either as a \"place of lodging'' or as a \"social service center establishment,'' or as both.\n\nA private home, by itself, does not fall within any of the 12 categories. However, it can be covered as a place of public accommodation to the extent that it is used as a facility that would fall within one of the 12 categories. For example, if a professional office of a dentist, doctor, or psychologist is located in a private home, the portion of the home dedicated to office use (including areas used both for the residence and the office, e.g., the entrance to the home that is also used as the entrance to the professional office) would be considered a place of public accommodation. Places of public accommodation located in residential facilities are specifically addressed in Sec.36.\n\n207. If a tour of a commercial facility that is not otherwise a place of public accommodation, such as, for example, a factory or a movie studio production set, is open to the general public, the route followed by the tour is a place of public accommodation and the tour must be operated in accordance with the rule's requirements for public accommodations. The place of public accommodation defined by the tour does not include those portions of the commercial facility that are merely viewed from the tour route. Hence, the barrier removal requirements of Sec.36.304 only apply to the physical route followed by the tour participants and not to work stations or other areas that are merely adjacent to, or within view of, the tour route. If the tour is not open to the general public, but rather is conducted, for example, for selected business colleagues, partners, customers, or consultants, the tour route is not a place of public accommodation and the tour is not subject to the requirements for public accommodations.\n\nPublic accommodations that receive Federal financial assistance are subject to the requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act as well as the requirements of the ADA.\n\nPrivate schools, including elementary and secondary schools, are covered by the rule as places of public accommodation. The rule itself, however, does not require a private school to provide a free appropriate education or develop an individualized education program in accordance with regulations of the Department of Education implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (34 CFR part 104), and regulations implementing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (34 CFR part 300). The receipt of Federal assistance by a private school, however, would trigger application of the Department of Education's regulations to the extent mandated by the particular type of assistance received.\n\n\"Private club.'' The term \"private club'' is defined in accordance with section 307 of the ADA as a private club or establishment exempted from coverage under title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title II of the 1964 Act exempts any \"private club or other establishment not in fact open to the public, except to the extent that the facilities of such establishment are made available to the customers or patrons of [a place of public accommodation as defined in title II].'' The rule, therefore, as reflected in Sec.36.102(e) of the application section, limits the coverage of private clubs accordingly. The obligations of a private club that rents space to any other private entity for the operation of a place of public accommodation are discussed further in connection with Sec.36.\n\n201. In determining whether a private entity qualifies as a private club under title II, courts have considered such factors as the degree of member control of club operations, the selectivity of the membership selection process, whether substantial membership fees are charged, whether the entity is operated on a nonprofit basis, the extent to which the facilities are open to the public, the degree of public funding, and whether the club was created specifically to avoid compliance with the Civil Rights Act. See e.g., Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Ass'n, 410 U.S. 431 (1973); Daniel v. Paul, 395 U.S. 298 (1969); Olzman v. Lake Hills Swim Club, Inc., 495 F.2d 1333 (2d Cir. 1974); Anderson v. Pass Christian Isles Golf Club, Inc., 488 F.2d 855 (5th Cir. 1974); Smith v. YMCA, 462 F.2d 634 (5th Cir. 1972); Stout v. YMCA, 404 F.2d 687 (5th Cir. 1968); United States v. Richberg, 398 F.2d 523 (5th Cir. 1968); Nesmith v. YMCA, 397 F.2d 96 (4th Cir. 1968); United States v. Lansdowne Swim Club, 713 F. Supp. 785 (E.D. Pa. 1989); Durham v. Red Lake Fishing and Hunting Club, Inc., 666 F. Supp. 954 (W.D. Tex. 1987); New York v. Ocean Club, Inc., 602 F. Supp. 489 (E.D.N.Y. 1984); Brown v. Loudoun Golf and Country Club, Inc., 573 F. Supp. 399 (E.D. Va. 1983); United States v. Trustees of Fraternal Order of Eagles, 472 F. Supp. 1174 (E.D. Wis. 1979); Cornelius v. Benevolent Protective Order of Elks, 382 F. Supp. 1182 (D. Conn. 1974).\n\n\"Private entity.'' The term \"private entity'' is defined as any individual or entity other than a public entity. It is used as part of the definition of \"public accommodation'' in this section.\n\nThe definition adds \"individual'' to the statutory definition of private entity (see section 301(6) of the ADA). This addition clarifies that an individual may be a private entity and, therefore, may be considered a public accommodation if he or she owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation. The explicit inclusion of individuals under the definition of private entity is consistent with section 302(a) of the ADA, which broadly prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.",

    "content": "The explicit inclusion of individuals under the definition of private entity is consistent with section 302(a) of the ADA, which broadly prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.\n\n\"Public accommodation.'' The term \"public accommodation'' means a private entity that owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation. The regulatory term, \"public accommodation,'' corresponds to the statutory term, \"person,'' in section 302(a) of the ADA. The ADA prohibits discrimination \"by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.'' The text of the regulation consequently places the ADA's nondiscrimination obligations on \"public accommodations'' rather than on \"persons'' or on \"places of public accommodation.''\n\nAs stated in Sec.36.102(b)(2), the requirements of subparts B and C obligate a public accommodation only with respect to the operations of a place of public accommodation. A public accommodation must also meet the requirements of subpart D with respect to facilities used as, or designed or constructed for use as, places of public accommodation or commercial facilities.\n\n\"Public entity.'' The term \"public entity'' is defined in accordance with section 201(1) of the ADA as any State or local government; any department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or States or local government; and the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, and any commuter authority (as defined in section 103(8) of the Rail Passenger Service Act). It is used in the definition of \"private entity'' in Sec.36.\n\n104. Public entities are excluded from the definition of private entity and therefore cannot qualify as public accommodations under this regulation. However, the actions of public entities are covered by title II of the ADA and by the Department's title II regulations codified at 28 CFR part 35.\n\n\"Qualified interpreter.'' The Department received substantial comment regarding the lack of a definition of \"qualified interpreter.'' The proposed rule defined auxiliary aids and services to include the statutory term, \"qualified interpreters'' (Sec.36.303(b)), but did not define that term. Section 36.303 requires the use of a qualified interpreter where necessary to achieve effective communication, unless an undue burden or fundamental alteration would result. Commenters stated that a lack of guidance on what the term means would create confusion among those trying to secure interpreting services and often result in less than effective communication.\n\nMany commenters were concerned that, without clear guidance on the issue of \"qualified'' interpreter, the rule would be interpreted to mean \"available, rather than qualified'' interpreters. Some claimed that few public accommodations would understand the difference between a qualified interpreter and a person who simply knows a few signs or how to fingerspell.\n\nIn order to clarify what is meant by \"qualified interpreter'' the Department has added a definition of the term to the final rule. A qualified interpreter means an interpreter who is able to interpret effectively, accurately, and impartially both receptively and expressively, using any necessary specialized vocabulary. This definition focuses on the actual ability of the interpreter in a particular interpreting context to facilitate effective communication between the public accommodation and the individual with disabilities.\n\n\"Readily achievable.'' The definition of \"readily achievable'' follows the statutory definition of that term in section 301(9) of the ADA. Readily achievable means easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense. The term is used as a limitation on the obligation to remove barriers under Sec..36.304(a), 36.305(a), 36.308(a), and 36.310(b). Further discussion of the meaning and application of the term \"readily achievable'' may be found in the preamble section for Sec.36.\n\n304. The definition lists factors to be considered in determining whether barrier removal is readily achievable in any particular circumstance. A significant number of commenters objected to Sec.36.306 of the proposed rule, which listed identical factors to be considered for determining \"readily achievable'' and \"undue burden'' together in one section. They asserted that providing a consolidated section blurred the distinction between the level of effort required by a public accommodation under the two standards. The readily achievable standard is a \"lower'' standard than the \"undue burden'' standard in terms of the level of effort required, but the factors used in determining whether an action is readily achievable or would result in an undue burden are identical (See Education and Labor report at 109). Although the preamble to the proposed rule clearly delineated the relationship between the two standards, to eliminate any confusion the Department has deleted Sec.36.306 of the proposed rule. That section, in any event, as other commenters noted, had merely repeated the lists of factors contained in the definitions of readily achievable and undue burden.\n\nThe list of factors included in the definition is derived from section 301(9) of the ADA. It reflects the congressional intention that a wide range of factors be considered in determining whether an action is readily achievable. It also takes into account that many local facilities are owned or operated by parent corporations or entities that conduct operations at many different sites. This section makes clear that, in some instances, resources beyond those of the local facility where the barrier must be removed may be relevant in determining whether an action is readily achievable. One must also evaluate the degree to which any parent entity has resources that may be allocated to the local facility.\n\nThe statutory list of factors in section 301(9) of the Act uses the term \"covered entity'' to refer to the larger entity of which a particular facility may be a part. \"Covered entity'' is not a defined term in the ADA and is not used consistently throughout the Act. The definition, therefore, substitutes the term \"parent entity'' in place of \"covered entity'' in paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) when referring to the larger private entity whose overall resources may be taken into account. This usage is consistent with the House Judiciary Committee's use of the term \"parent company'' to describe the larger entity of which the local facility is a part (H.R. Rep. No. 485, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 3, at 40 - 41, 54 - 55 (1990) (hereinafter \"Judiciary report'')).",

    "content": "3, at 40 - 41, 54 - 55 (1990) (hereinafter \"Judiciary report'')).\n\nA number of commenters asked for more specific guidance as to when and how the resources of a parent corporation or entity are to be taken into account in determining what is readily achievable. The Department believes that this complex issue is most appropriately resolved on a case-by-case basis. As the comments reflect, there is a wide variety of possible relationships between the site in question and any parent corporation or other entity. It would be unwise to posit legal ramifications under the ADA of even generic relationships (e.g., banks involved in foreclosures or insurance companies operating as trustees or in other similar fiduciary relationships), because any analysis will depend so completely on the detailed fact situations and the exact nature of the legal relationships involved. The final rule does, however, reorder the factors to be considered. This shift and the addition of the phrase \"if applicable'' make clear that the line of inquiry concerning factors will start at the site involved in the action itself. This change emphasizes that the overall resources, size, and operations of the parent corporation or entity should be considered to the extent appropriate in light of \"the geographic separateness, and the administrative or fiscal relationship of the site or sites in question to any parent corporation or entity.''\n\nAlthough some commenters sought more specific numerical guidance on the definition of readily achievable, the Department has declined to establish in the final rule any kind of numerical formula for determining whether an action is readily achievable. It would be difficult to devise a specific ceiling on compliance costs that would take into account the vast diversity of enterprises covered by the ADA's public accommodations requirements and the economic situation that any particular entity would find itself in at any moment. The final rule, therefore, implements the flexible case-by-case approach chosen by Congress.\n\nA number of commenters requested that security considerations be explicitly recognized as a factor in determining whether a barrier removal action is readily achievable. The Department believes that legitimate safety requirements, including crime prevention measures, may be taken into account so long as they are based on actual risks and are necessary for safe operation of the public accommodation. This point has been included in the definition.\n\nSome commenters urged the Department not to consider acts of barrier removal in complete isolation from each other in determining whether they are readily achievable. The Department believes that it is appropriate to consider the cost of other barrier removal actions as one factor in determining whether a measure is readily achievable.\n\n\"Religious entity.'' The term \"religious entity'' is defined in accordance with section 307 of the ADA as a religious organization or entity controlled by a religious organization, including a place of worship. Section 36.102(e) of the rule states that the rule does not apply to any religious entity.\n\nThe ADA's exemption of religious organizations and religious entities controlled by religious organizations is very broad, encompassing a wide variety of situations. Religious organizations and entities controlled by religious organizations have no obligations under the ADA. Even when a religious organization carries out activities that would othervise make it a public accommodation, the religious organization is exempt from ADA coverage. Thus, if a church itself operates a day care center, a SNF, a private school, or a diocesan school system, the operations of the center, home, school, or schools would not be subject to the requirements of the ADA or this part. The religious entity would not lose its exemption merely because the services provided were open to the general public. The test is whether the church or other religious organization operates the public accommodation, not which individuals receive the public accommodation's services.\n\nReligious entities that are controlled by religious organizations are also exempt from the ADA's requirements. Many religious organizations in the United States use lay boards and other secular or corporate mechanisms to operate schools and an array of social services. The use of a lay board or other mechanism does not itself remove the ADA's religious exemption. Thus, a parochial school, having religious doctrine in its curriculum and sponsored by a religious order, could be exempt either as a religious organization or as an entity controlled by a religious organization, even if it has a lay board. The test remains a factual one -- whether the church or other religious organization controls the operations of the school or of the service or whether the school or service is itself a religious organization.\n\nAlthough a religious organization or a religious entity that is controlled by a religious organization has no obligations under the rule, a public accommodation that is not itself a religious organization, but that operates a place of public accommodation in leased space on the property of a religious entity, which is not a place of worship, is subject to the rule's requirements if it is not under control of a religious organization. When a church rents meeting space, which is not a place of worship, to a local community group or to a private, independent day care center, the ADA applies to the activities of the local community group and day care center if a lease exists and consideration is paid.\n\n\"Service animal.'' The term \"service animal'' encompasses any guide dog, signal dog, or other animal individually trained to provide assistance to an individual with a disability. The term is used in Sec.36.302(c), which requires public accommodations generally to modify policies, practices, and procedures to accommodate the use of service animals in places of public accommodation.\n\n\"Specified public transportation.'' The definition of \"specified public transportation'' is identical to the statutory definition in section 301(10) of the ADA. The term means transportation by bus, rail, or any other conveyance (other than by aircraft) that provides the general public with general or special service (including charter service) on a regular and continuing basis. It is used in category (7) of the definition of \"place of public accommodation,'' which includes stations used for specified public transportation.\n\nThe effect of this definition, which excludes transportation by aircraft, is that it excludes privately operated airports from coverage as places of public accommodation. However, places of public accommodation located within airports would be covered by this part. Airports that are operated by public entities are covered by title II of the ADA and, if they are operated as part of a program receiving Federal financial assistance, by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Privately operated airports are similarly covered by section 504 if they are operated as part of a program receiving Federal financial assistance. The operations of any portion of any airport that are under the control of an air carrier are covered by the Air Carrier Access Act. In addition, airports are covered as commercial facilities under this rule.\n\n\"State.'' The definition of \"State'' is identical to the statutory definition in section 3(3) of the ADA. The term is used in the definitions of \"commerce'' and \"public entity'' in Sec.36.",

    "content": "\"State.'' The definition of \"State'' is identical to the statutory definition in section 3(3) of the ADA. The term is used in the definitions of \"commerce'' and \"public entity'' in Sec.36.\n\n104. \"Undue burden.'' The definition of \"undue burden'' is analogous to the statutory definition of \"undue hardship'' in employment under section 101(10) of the ADA. The term undue burden means \"significant difficulty or expense'' and serves as a limitation on the obligation to provide auxiliary aids and services under Sec.36.303 and Sec..36.309 (b)(3) and (c)(3). Further discussion of the meaning and application of the term undue burden may be found in the preamble discussion of Sec.36.\n\n303. The definition lists factors considered in determining whether provision of an auxiliary aid or service in any particular circumstance would result in an undue burden. The factors to be considered in determining whether an action would result in an undue burden are identical to those to be considered in determining whether an action is readily achievable. However, \"readily achievable'' is a lower standard than \"undue burden'' in that it requires a lower level of effort on the part of the public accommodation (see Education and Labor report at 109).\n\nFurther analysis of the factors to be considered in determining undue burden may be found in the preamble discussion of the definition of the term \"readily achievable.''\n\nSubpart B -- General Requirements\n\nSubpart B includes general prohibitions restricting a public accommodation from discriminating against people with disabilities by denying them the opportunity to benefit from goods or services, by giving them unequal goods or services, or by giving them different or separate goods or services. These general prohibitions are patterned after the basic, general prohibitions that exist in other civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, or national origin.\n\nSection 36.201 General\n\nSection 36.201(a) contains the general rule that prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation.\n\nFull and equal enjoyment means the right to participate and to have an equal opportunity to obtain the same results as others to the extent possible with such accommodations as may be required by the Act and these regulations. It does not mean that an individual with a disability must achieve an identical result or level of achievement as persons without a disability. For example, an exercise class cannot exclude a person who uses a wheelchair because he or she cannot do all of the exercises and derive the same result from the class as persons without a disability.\n\nSection 302(a) of the ADA states that the prohibition against discrimination applies to \"any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation,'' and this language is reflected in Sec.36.201(a). The coverage is quite extensive and would include sublessees, management companies, and any other entity that owns, leases, leases to, or operates a place of public accommodation, even if the operation is only for a short time.\n\nThe first sentence of paragraph (b) of Sec.36.201 reiterates the general principle that both the landlord that owns the building that houses the place of public accommodation, as well as the tenant that owns or operates the place of public accommodation, are public accommodations subject to the requirements of this part. Although the statutory language could be interpreted as placing equal responsibility on all private entities, whether lessor, lessee, or operator of a public accommodation, the committee reports suggest that liability may be allocated. Section 36.201(b) of that section of the proposed rule attempted to allocate liability in the regulation itself. Paragraph (b)(2) of that section made a specific allocation of liability for the obligation to take readily achievable measures to remove barriers, and paragraph (b)(3) made a specific allocation for the obligation to provide auxiliary aids.\n\nNumerous commenters pointed out that these allocations would not apply in all situations. Some asserted that paragraph (b)(2) of the proposed rule only addressed the situation when a lease gave the tenant the right to make alterations with permission of the landlord, but failed to address other types of leases, e.g., those that are silent on the right to make alterations, or those in which the landlord is not permitted to enter a tenant's premises to make alterations. Several commenters noted that many leases contain other clauses more relevant to the ADA than the alterations clause. For example, many leases contain a \"compliance clause,'' a clause which allocates responsibility to a particular party for compliance with all relevant Federal, State, and local laws. Many commenters pointed out various types of relationships that were left unaddressed by the regulation, e.g., sale and leaseback arrangements where the landlord is a financial institution with no control or responsibility for the building; franchises; subleases; and management companies which, at least in the hotel industry, often have control over operations but are unable to make modifications to the premises.\n\nSome commenters raised specific questions as to how the barrier removal allocation would work as a practical matter. Paragraph (b)(2) of the proposed rule provided that the burden of making readily achievable modifications within the tenant's place of public accommodation would shift to the landlord when the modifications were not readily achievable for the tenant or when the landlord denied a tenant's request for permission to make such modifications. Commenters noted that the rule did not specify exactly when the burden would actually shift from tenant to landlord and whether the landlord would have to accept a tenant's word that a particular action is not readily achievable. Others questioned if the tenant should be obligated to use alternative methods of barrier removal before the burden shifts. In light of the fact that readily achievable removal of barriers can include such actions as moving of racks and displays, some commenters doubted the appropriateness of requiring a landlord to become involved in day-to-day operations of its tenants' businesses.\n\nThe Department received widely differing comments in response to the preamble question asking whether landlord and tenant obligations should vary depending on the length of time remaining on an existing lease. Many suggested that tenants should have no responsibilities in \"shorter leases,'' which commenters defined as ranging anywhere from 90 days to three years. Other commenters pointed out that the time remaining on the lease should not be a factor in the rule's allocation of responsibilities, but is relevant in determining what is readily achievable for the tenant. The Department agrees with this latter approach and will interpret the rule in that manner.",

    "content": "The Department agrees with this latter approach and will interpret the rule in that manner.\n\nIn recognition of the somewhat limited applicability of the allocation scheme contained in the proposed rule, paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) have been deleted from the final rule. The Department has substituted instead a statement that allocation of responsibility as between the parties for taking readily achievable measures to remove barriers and to provide auxiliary aids and services both in common areas and within places of public accommodation may be determined by the lease or other contractual relationships between the parties. The ADA was not intended to change existing landlord/tenant responsibilities as set forth in the lease. By deleting specific provisions from the rule, the Department gives full recognition to this principle. As between the landlord and tenant, the extent of responsibility for particular obligations may be, and in many cases probably will be, determined by contract.\n\nThe suggested allocation of responsibilities contained in the proposed rule may be used if appropriate in a particular situation. Thus, the landlord would generally be held responsible for making readily achievable changes and providing auxiliary aids and services in common areas and for modifying policies, practices, or procedures applicable to all tenants, and the tenant would generally be responsible for readily achievable changes, provision of auxiliary aids, and modification of policies within its own place of public accommodation.\n\nMany commenters objected to the proposed rule's allocation of responsibility for providing auxiliary aids and services solely to the tenant, pointing out that this exclusive allocation may not be appropriate in the case of larger public accommodations that operate their businesses by renting space out to smaller public accommodations. For example, large theaters often rent to smaller traveling companies and hospitals often rely on independent contractors to provide childbirth classes. Groups representing persons with disabilities objected to the proposed rule because, in their view, it permitted the large theater or hospital to evade ADA responsibilities by leasing to independent smaller entities. They suggested that these types of public accommodations are not really landlords because they are in the business of providing a service, rather than renting space, as in the case of a shopping center or office building landlord. These commenters believed that responsibility for providing auxiliary aids should shift to the landlord, if the landlord relies on a smaller public accommodation or independent contractor to provide services closely related to those of the larger public accommodation, and if the needed auxiliary aids prove to be an undue burden for the smaller public accommodation. The final rule no longer lists specific allocations to specific parties but, rather, leaves allocation of responsibilities to the lease negotiations. Parties are, therefore, free to allocate the responsibility for auxiliary aids.\n\nSection 36.201(b)(4) of the proposed rule, which provided that alterations by a tenant on its own premises do not trigger a path of travel obligation on the landlord, has been moved to Sec.36.403(d) of the final rule.\n\nAn entity that is not in and of itself a public accommodation, such as a trade association or performing artist, may become a public accommodation when it leases space for a conference or performance at a hotel, convention center, or stadium. For an entity to become a public accommodation when it is the lessee of space, however, the Department believes that consideration in some form must be given. Thus, a Boy Scout troop that accepts donated space does not become a public accommodation because the troop has not \"leased'' space, as required by the ADA.\n\nAs a public accommodation, the trade association or performing artist will be responsible for compliance with this part. Specific responsibilities should be allocated by contract, but, generally, the lessee should be responsible for providing auxiliary aids and services (which could include interpreters, Braille programs, etc.) for the participants in its conference or performance as well as for assuring that displays are accessible to individuals with disabilities.\n\nSome commenters suggested that the rule should allocate responsibilities for areas other than removal of barriers and auxiliary aids. The final rule leaves allocation of all areas to the lease negotiations. However, in general landlords should not be given responsibility for policies a tenant applies in operating its business, if such policies are solely those of the tenant. Thus, if a restaurant tenant discriminates by refusing to seat a patron, it would be the tenant, and not the landlord, who would be responsible, because the discriminatory policy is imposed solely by the tenant and not by the landlord. If, however, a tenant refuses to modify a \"no pets'' rule to allow service animals in its restaurant because the landlord mandates such a rule, then both the landlord and the tenant would be liable for violation of the ADA when a person with a service dog is refused entrance. The Department wishes to emphasize, however, that the parties are free to allocate responsibilities in any way they choose.\n\nPrivate clubs are also exempt from the ADA. However, consistent with title II of the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. 2000a(e), a private club is considered a public accommodation to the extent that \"the facilities of such establishment are made available to the customers or patrons'' of a place of public accommodation. Thus, if a private club runs a day care center that is open exclusively to its own members, the club, like the church in the example above, would have no responsibility for compliance with the ADA. Nor would the day care center have any responsibilities because it is part of the private club exempt from the ADA.\n\nOn the other hand, if the private club rents to a day care center that is open to the public, then the private club would have the same obligations as any other public accommodation that functions as a landlord with respect to compliance with title III within the day care center. In such a situation, both the private club that \"leases to'' a public accommodation and the public accommodation lessee (the day care center) would be subject to the ADA. This same principle would apply if the private club were to rent to, for example, a bar association, which is not generally a public accommodation but which, as explained above, becomes a public accommodation when it leases space for a conference.\n\nSection 36.202 Activities\n\nSection 36.202 sets out the general forms of discrimination prohibited by title III of the ADA. These general prohibitions are further refined by the specific prohibitions in subpart C. Section 36.213 makes clear that the limitations on the ADA's requirements contained in subpart C, such as \"necessity'' (Sec.36.301(a)) and \"safety'' (Sec.36.301(b)), are applicable to the prohibitions in Sec.36.\n\n202. Thus, it is unnecessary to add these limitations to Sec.36.202 as has been requested by some commenters. In addition, the language of Sec.36.202 very closely tracks the language of section 302(b)(1)(A) of the Act, and that statutory provision does not expressly contain these limitations.\n\nDeny participation -- Section 36.202(a) provides that it is discriminatory to deny a person with a disability the right to participate in or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of a place of public accommodation.",

    "content": "Deny participation -- Section 36.202(a) provides that it is discriminatory to deny a person with a disability the right to participate in or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of a place of public accommodation.\n\nA public accommodation may not exclude persons with disabilities on the basis of disability for reasons other than those specifically set forth in this part. For example, a public accommodation cannot refuse to serve a person with a disability because its insurance company conditions coverage or rates on the absence of persons with disabilities. This is a frequent basis of exclusion from a variety of community activities and is prohibited by this part.\n\nUnequal benefit -- Section 36.202(b) prohibits services or accommodations that are not equal to those provided others. For example, persons with disabilities must not be limited to certain performances at a theater.\n\nSeparate benefit -- Section 36.202(c) permits different or separate benefits or services only when necessary to provide persons with disabilities opportunities as effective as those provided others. This paragraph permitting separate benefits \"when necessary'' should be read together with Sec.36.203(a), which requires integration in \"the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of the individual.'' The preamble to that section provides further guidance on separate programs. Thus, this section would not prohibit the designation of parking spaces for persons with disabilities.\n\nEach of the three paragraphs (a) - (c) prohibits discrimination against an individual or class of individuals \"either directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements.'' The intent of the contractual prohibitions of these paragraphs is to prohibit a public accommodation from doing indirectly, through a contractual relationship, what it may not do directly. Thus, the \"individual or class of individuals'' referenced in the three paragraphs is intended to refer to the clients and customers of the public accommodation that entered into a contractual arrangement. It is not intended to encompass the clients or customers of other entities. A public accommodation, therefore, is not liable under this provision for discrimination that may be practiced by those with whom it has a contractual relationship, when that discrimination is not directed against its own clients or customers. For example, if an amusement park contracts with a food service company to operate its restaurants at the park, the amusement park is not responsible for other operations of the food service company that do not involve clients or customers of the amusement park. Section 36.202(d) makes this clear by providing that the term \"individual or class of individuals'' refers to the clients or customers of the public accommodation that enters into the contractual, licensing, or other arrangement.\n\nSection 36.203 Integrated Settings\n\nSection 36.203 addresses the integration of persons with disabilities. The ADA recognizes that the provision of goods and services in an integrated manner is a fundamental tenet of nondiscrimination on the basis of disability. Providing segregated accommodations and services relegates persons with disabilities to the status of second-class citizens. For example, it would be a violation of this provision to require persons with mental disabilities to eat in the back room of a restaurant or to refuse to allow a person with a disability the full use of a health spa because of stereotypes about the person's ability to participate. Section 36.203(a) states that a public accommodation shall afford goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations to an individual with a disability in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of the individual. Section 36.203(b) specifies that, notwithstanding the existence of separate or different programs or activities provided in accordance with this section, an individual with a disability shall not be denied the opportunity to participate in such programs or activities that are not separate or different. Section 306.203(c), which is derived from section 501(d) of the Americans with Disabilities Act, states that nothing in this part shall be construed to require an individual with a disability to accept an accommodation, aid, service, opportunity, or benefit that he or she chooses not to accept.\n\nTaken together, these provisions are intended to prohibit exclusion and segregation of individuals with disabilities and the denial of equal opportunities enjoyed by others, based on, among other things, presumptions, patronizing attitudes, fears, and stereotypes about individuals with disabilities. Consistent with these standards, public accommodations are required to make decisions based on facts applicable to individuals and not on the basis of presumptions as to what a class of individuals with disabilities can or cannot do.\n\nSections 36.203 (b) and (c) make clear that individuals with disabilities cannot be denied the opportunity to participate in programs that are not separate or different. This is an important and overarching principle of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Separate, special, or different programs that are designed to provide a benefit to persons with disabilities cannot be used to restrict the participation of persons with disabilities in general, integrated activities.\n\nFor example, a person who is blind may wish to decline participating in a special museum tour that allows persons to touch sculptures in an exhibit and instead tour the exhibit at his or her own pace with the museum's recorded tour. It is not the intent of this section to require the person who is blind to avail himself or herself of the special tour. Modified participation for persons with disabilities must be a choice, not a requirement.\n\nFurther, it would not be a violation of this section for an establishment to offer recreational programs specially designed for children with mobility impairments in those limited circumstances. However, it would be a violation of this section if the entity then excluded these children from other recreational services made available to nondisabled children, or required children with disabilities to attend only designated programs.\n\nMany commenters asked that the Department clarify a public accommodation's obligations within the integrated program when it offers a separate program, but an individual with a disability chooses not to participate in the separate program. It is impossible to make a blanket statement as to what level of auxiliary aids or modifications are required in the integrated program. Rather, each situation must be assessed individually. Assuming the integrated program would be appropriate for a particular individual, the extent to which that individual must be provided with modifications will depend not only on what the individual needs but also on the limitations set forth in subpart C. For example, it may constitute an undue burden for a particular public accommodation, which provides a full-time interpreter in its special guided tour for individuals with hearing impairments, to hire an additional interpreter for those individuals who choose to attend the integrated program. The Department cannot identify categorically the level of assistance or aid required in the integrated program.",

    "content": "The Department cannot identify categorically the level of assistance or aid required in the integrated program.\n\nThe preamble to the proposed rule contained a statement that some interpreted as encouraging the continuation of separate schools, sheltered workshops, special recreational programs, and other similar programs. It is important to emphasize that Sec.36.202(c) only calls for separate programs when such programs are \"necessary'' to provide as effective an opportunity to individuals with disabilities as to other individuals. Likewise, Sec.36.203(a) only permits separate programs when a more integrated setting would not be \"appropriate.'' Separate programs are permitted, then, in only limited circumstances. The sentence at issue has been deleted from the preamble because it was too broadly stated and had been erroneously interpreted as Departmental encouragement of separate programs without qualification.\n\nThe proposed rule's reference in Sec.36.203(b) to separate programs or activities provided in accordance with \"this section'' has been changed to \"this subpart'' in recognition of the fact that separate programs or activities may, in some limited circumstances, be permitted not only by Sec.36.203(a) but also by Sec.36.202(c).\n\nIn addition, some commenters suggested that the individual with the disability is the only one who can decide whether a setting is \"appropriate'' and what the \"needs'' are. Others suggested that only the public accommodation can make these determinations. The regulation does not give exclusive responsibility to either party. Rather, the determinations are to be made based on an objective view, presumably one which would take into account views of both parties.\n\nSome commenters expressed concern that Sec.36.203(c), which states that nothing in the rule requires an individual with a disability to accept special accommodations and services provided under the ADA, could be interpreted to allow guardians of infants or older people with disabilities to refuse medical treatment for their wards. Section 36.203(c) has been revised to make it clear that paragraph (c) is inapplicable to the concern of the commenters. A new paragraph (c)(2) has been added stating that nothing in the regulation authorizes the representative or guardian of an individual with a disability to decline food, water, medical treatment, or medical services for that individual. New paragraph (c) clarifies that neither the ADA nor the regulation alters current Federal law ensuring the rights of incompetent individuals with disabilities to receive food, water, and medical treatment. See, e.g., Child Abuse Amendments of 1984 (42 U.S.C. 5106a(b)(10), 5106g(10)); Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C 794); Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (42 U.S.C. 6042).\n\nSections 36.203(c) (1) and (2) are based on section 501(d) of the ADA. Section Sec.501(d) was designed to clarify that nothing in the ADA requires individuals with disabilities to accept special accommodations and services for individuals with disabilities that may segregate them:\n\nThe Committee added this section (501(d)) to clarify that nothing in the ADA is intended to permit discriminatory treatment on the basis of disability, even when such treatment is rendered under the guise of providing an accommodation, service, aid or benefit to the individual with disability. For example, a blind individual may choose not to avail himself or herself of the right to go to the front of a line, even if a particular public accommodation has chosen to offer such a modification of a policy for blind individuals. Or, a blind individual may choose to decline to participate in a special museum tour that allows persons to touch sculptures in an exhibit and instead tour the exhibits at his or her own pace with the museum's recorded tour.\n\n(Judiciary report at 71 - 72.) The Act is not to be construed to mean that an individual with disabilities must accept special accommodations and services for individuals with disabilities when that individual chooses to participate in the regular services already offered. Because medical treatment, including treatment for particular conditions, is not a special accommodation or service for individuals with disabilities under section 501(d), neither the Act nor this part provides affirmative authority to suspend such treatment. Section 501(d) is intended to clarify that the Act is not designed to foster discrimination through mandatory acceptance of special services when other alternatives are provided; this concern does not reach to the provision of medical treatment for the disabling condition itself.\n\nSection 36.213 makes clear that the limitations contained in subpart C are to be read into subpart B. Thus, the integration requirement is subject to the various defenses contained in subpart C, such as safety, if eligibility criteria are at issue (Sec.36.301(b)), or fundamental alteration and undue burden, if the concern is provision of auxiliary aids (Sec.36.303(a)).\n\nSection 36.204 Administrative Methods\n\nSection 36.204 specifies that an individual or entity shall not, directly, or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize standards or criteria or methods of administration that have the effect of discriminating on the basis of disability or that perpetuate the discrimination of others who are subject to common administrative control. The preamble discussion of Sec.36.301 addresses eligibility criteria in detail.\n\nSection 36.204 is derived from section 302(b)(1)(D) of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and it uses the same language used in the employment section of the ADA (section 102(b)(3)). Both sections incorporate a disparate impact standard to ensure the effectiveness of the legislative mandate to end discrimination. This standard is consistent with the interpretation of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme Court in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985). The Court in Choate explained that members of Congress made numerous statements during passage of section 504 regarding eliminating architectural barriers, providing access to transportation, and eliminating discriminatory effects of job qualification procedures. The Court then noted: \"These statements would ring hollow if the resulting legislation could not rectify the harms resulting from action that discriminated by effect as well as by design.'' Id at 297 (footnote omitted).\n\nOf course, Sec.36.204 is subject to the various limitations contained in subpart C including, for example, necessity (Sec.36.301(a)), safety (Sec.36.301(b)), fundamental alteration (Sec.36.302(a)), readily achievable (Sec.36.304(a)), and undue burden (Sec.36.303(a)).\n\nSection 36.205 Association\n\nSection 36.205 implements section 302(b)(1)(E) of the Act, which provides that a public accommodation shall not exclude or otherwise deny equal goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, accommodations, or other opportunities to an individual or entity because of the known disability of an individual with whom the individual or entity is known to have a relationship or association. This section is unchanged from the proposed rule.\n\nThe individuals covered under this section include any individuals who are discriminated against because of their known association with an individual with a disability. For example, it would be a violation of this part for a day care center to refuse admission to a child because his or her brother has HIV disease.\n\nThis protection is not limited to those who have a familial relationship with the individual who has a disability. If a place of public accommodation refuses admission to a person with cerebral palsy and his or her companions, the companions have an independent right of action under the ADA and this section.",

    "content": "If a place of public accommodation refuses admission to a person with cerebral palsy and his or her companions, the companions have an independent right of action under the ADA and this section.\n\nDuring the legislative process, the term \"entity'' was added to section 302(b)(1)(E) to clarify that the scope of the provision is intended to encompass not only persons who have a known association with a person with a disability, but also entities that provide services to or are otherwise associated with such individuals. This provision was intended to ensure that entities such as health care providers, employees of social service agencies, and others who provide professional services to persons with disabilities are not subjected to discrimination because of their professional association with persons with disabilities. For example, it would be a violation of this section to terminate the lease of a entity operating an independent living center for persons with disabilities, or to seek to evict a health care provider because that individual or entity provides services to persons with mental impairments.\n\nSection 36.206 Retaliation or Coercion\n\nSection 36.206 implements section 503 of the ADA, which prohibits retaliation against any individual who exercises his or her rights under the Act. This section is unchanged from the proposed rule. Paragraph (a) of Sec.36.206 provides that no private entity or public entity shall discriminate against any individual because that individual has exercised his or her right to oppose any act or practice made unlawful by this part, or because that individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Act or this part.\n\nParagraph (b) provides that no private entity or public entity shall coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any individual in the exercise of his or her rights under this part or because that individual aided or encouraged any other individual in the exercise or enjoyment of any right granted or protected by the Act or this part.\n\nIllustrations of practices prohibited by this section are contained in paragraph (c), which is modeled on a similar provision in the regulations issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to implement the Fair Housing Act (see 24 CFR 100.400(c)(l)). Prohibited actions may include:\n\n(1) Coercing an individual to deny or limit the benefits, services, or advantages to which he or she is entitled under the Act or this part;\n\n(2) Threatening, intimidating, or interfering with an individual who is seeking to obtain or use the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of a public accommodation;\n\n(3) Intimidating or threatening any person because that person is assisting or encouraging an individual or group entitled to claim the rights granted or protected by the Act or this part to exercise those rights; or\n\n(4) Retaliating against any person because that person has participated in any investigation or action to enforce the Act or this part.\n\nThis section protects not only individuals who allege a violation of the Act or this part, but also any individuals who support or assist them. This section applies to all investigations or proceedings initiated under the Act or this part without regard to the ultimate resolution of the underlying allegations. Because this section prohibits any act of retaliation or coercion in response to an individual's effort to exercise rights established by the Act and this part (or to support the efforts of another individual), the section applies not only to public accommodations that are otherwise subject to this part, but also to individuals other than public accommodations or to public entities. For example, it would be a violation of the Act and this part for a private individual, e.g., a restaurant customer, to harass or intimidate an individual with a disability in an effort to prevent that individual from patronizing the restaurant. It would, likewise, be a violation of the Act and this part for a public entity to take adverse action against an employee who appeared as a witness on behalf of an individual who sought to enforce the Act.\n\nSection 36.207 Places of Public Accommodation Located in Private Residences\n\nA private home used exclusively as a residence is not covered by title III because it is neither a \"commercial facility'' nor a \"place of public accommodation.'' In some situations, however, a private home is not used exclusively as a residence, but houses a place of public accommodation in all or part of a home (e.g., an accountant who meets with his or her clients at his or her residence). Section 36.207(a) provides that those portions of the private residence used in the operation of the place of public accommodation are covered by this part.\n\nFor instance, a home or a portion of a home may be used as a day care center during the day and a residence at night. If all parts of the house are used for the day care center, then the entire residence is a place of public accommodation because no part of the house is used exclusively as a residence. If an accountant uses one room in the house solely as his or her professional office, then a portion of the house is used exclusively as a place of public accommodation and a portion is used exclusively as a residence. Section 36.207 provides that when a portion of a residence is used exclusively as a residence, that portion is not covered by this part. Thus, the portions of the accountant's house, other than the professional office and areas and spaces leading to it, are not covered by this part. All of the requirements of this rule apply to the covered portions, including requirements to make reasonable modifications in policies, eliminate discriminatory eligibility criteria, take readily achievable measures to remove barriers or provide readily achievable alternatives (e.g., making house calls), provide auxiliary aids and services and undertake only accessible new construction and alterations.\n\nParagraph (b) was added in response to comments that sought clarification on the extent of coverage of the private residence used as the place of public accommodation. The final rule makes clear that the place of accommodation extends to all areas of the home used by clients and customers of the place of public accommodation. Thus, the ADA would apply to any door or entry way, hallways, a restroom, if used by customers and clients; and any other portion of the residence, interior or exterior, used by customers or clients of the public accommodation. This interpretation is simply an application of the general rule for all public accommodations, which extends statutory requirements to all portions of the facility used by customers and clients, including, if applicable, restrooms, hallways, and approaches to the public accommodation. As with other public accommodations, barriers at the entrance and on the sidewalk leading up to the public accommodation, if the sidewalk is under the control of the public accommodation, must be removed if doing so is readily achievable.",

    "content": "As with other public accommodations, barriers at the entrance and on the sidewalk leading up to the public accommodation, if the sidewalk is under the control of the public accommodation, must be removed if doing so is readily achievable.\n\nThe Department recognizes that many businesses that operate out of personal residences are quite small, often employing only the homeowner and having limited total revenues. In these circumstances the effect of ADA coverage would likely be quite minimal. For example, because the obligation to remove existing architectural barriers is limited to those that are easily accomplishable without much difficulty or expense (see Sec.36.304), the range of required actions would be quite modest. It might not be readily achievable for such a place of public accommodation to remove any existing barriers. If it is not readily achievable to remove existing architectural barriers, a public accommodation located in a private residence may meet its obligations under the Act and this part by providing its goods or services to clients or customers with disabilities through the use of alternative measures, including delivery of goods or services in the home of the customer or client, to the extent that such alternative measures are readily achievable (See Sec.36.305).\n\nSome commenters asked for clarification as to how the new construction and alteration standards of subpart D will apply to residences. The new construction standards only apply to the extent that the residence or portion of the residence was designed or intended for use as a public accommodation. Thus, for example, if a portion of a home is designed or constructed for use exclusively as a lawyer's office or for use both as a lawyer's office and for residential purposes, then it must be designed in accordance with the new construction standards in the appendix. Likewise, if a homeowner is undertaking alterations to convert all or part of his residence to a place of public accommodation, that work must be done in compliance with the alterations standards in the appendix.\n\nThe preamble to the proposed rule addressed the applicable requirements when a commercial facility is located in a private residence. That situation is now addressed in Sec.36.401(b) of subpart D.\n\nSection 36.208 Direct Threat\n\nSection 36.208(a) implements section 302(b)(3) of the Act by providing that this part does not require a public accommodation to permit an individual to participate in or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of the public accommodation, if that individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others. This section is unchanged from the proposed rule.\n\nThe Department received a significant number of comments on this section. Commenters representing individuals with disabilities generally supported this provision, but suggested revisions to further limit its application. Commenters representing public accommodations generally endorsed modifications that would permit a public accommodation to exercise its own judgment in determining whether an individual poses a direct threat.\n\nThe inclusion of this provision is not intended to imply that persons with disabilities pose risks to others. It is intended to address concerns that may arise in this area. It establishes a strict standard that must be met before denying service to an individual with a disability or excluding that individual from participation.\n\nParagraph (b) of this section explains that a \"direct threat'' is a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids and services. This paragraph codifies the standard first applied by the Supreme Court in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273 (1987), in which the Court held that an individual with a contagious disease may be an \"individual with handicaps'' under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. In Arline, the Supreme Court recognized that there is a need to balance the interests of people with disabilities against legitimate concerns for public safety. Although persons with disabilities are generally entitled to the protection of this part, a person who poses a significant risk to others may be excluded if reasonable modifications to the public accommodation's policies, practices, or procedures will not eliminate that risk. The determination that a person poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others may not be based on generalizations or stereotypes about the effects of a particular disability; it must be based on an individual assessment that conforms to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.\n\nParagraph (c) establishes the test to use in determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others. A public accommodation is required to make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical evidence or on the best available objective evidence, to determine: The nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will mitigate the risk. This is the test established by the Supreme Court in Arline. Such an inquiry is essential if the law is to achieve its goal of protecting disabled individuals from discrimination based on prejudice, stereotypes, or unfounded fear, while giving appropriate weight to legitimate concerns, such as the need to avoid exposing others to significant health and safety risks. Making this assessment will not usually require the services of a physician. Sources for medical knowledge include guidance from public health authorities, such as the U.S. Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control, and the National Institutes of Health, including the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nMany of the commenters sought clarification of the inquiry requirement. Some suggested that public accommodations should be prohibited from making any inquiries to determine if an individual with a disability would pose a direct threat to other persons. The Department believes that to preclude all such inquiries would be inappropriate. Under Sec.36.301 of this part, a public accommodation is permitted to establish eligibility criteria necessary for the safe operation of the place of public accommodation. Implicit in that right is the right to ask if an individual meets the criteria. However, any eligibility or safety standard established by a public accommodation must be based on actual risk, not on speculation or stereotypes; it must be applied to all clients or customers of the place of public accommodation; and inquiries must be limited to matters necessary to the application of the standard.\n\nSome commenters suggested that the test established in the Arline decision, which was developed in the context of an employment case, is too stringent to apply in a public accommodations context where interaction between the public accommodation and its client or customer is often very brief. One suggested alternative was to permit public accommodations to exercise \"good faith'' judgment in determining whether an individual poses a direct threat, particularly when a public accommodation is dealing with a client or customer engaged in disorderly or disruptive behavior.",

    "content": "One suggested alternative was to permit public accommodations to exercise \"good faith'' judgment in determining whether an individual poses a direct threat, particularly when a public accommodation is dealing with a client or customer engaged in disorderly or disruptive behavior.\n\nThe Department believes that the ADA clearly requires that any determination to exclude an individual from participation must be based on an objective standard. A public accommodation may establish neutral eligibility criteria as a condition of receiving its goods or services. As long as these criteria are necessary for the safe provision of the public accommodation's goods and services and applied neutrally to all clients or customers, regardless of whether they are individuals with disabilities, a person who is unable to meet the criteria may be excluded from participation without inquiry into the underlying reason for the inability to comply. In places of public accommodation such as restaurants, theaters, or hotels, where the contact between the public accommodation and its clients is transitory, the uniform application of an eligibility standard precluding violent or disruptive behavior by any client or customer should be sufficient to enable a public accommodation to conduct its business in an orderly manner.\n\nSome other commenters asked for clarification of the application of this provision to persons, particularly children, who have short-term, contagious illnesses, such as fevers, influenza, or the common cold. It is common practice in schools and day care settings to exclude persons with such illnesses until the symptoms subside. The Department believes that these commenters misunderstand the scope of this rule. The ADA only prohibits discrimination against an individual with a disability. Under the ADA and this part, a \"disability'' is defined as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Common, short-term illnesses that predictably resolve themselves within a matter of days do not \"substantially limit'' a major life activity; therefore, it is not a violation of this part to exclude an individual from receiving the services of a public accommodation because of such transitory illness. However, this part does apply to persons who have long-term illnesses. Any determination with respect to a person who has a chronic or long-term illness must be made in compliance with the requirements of this section.\n\nSection 36.209 Illegal Use of Drugs\n\nSection 36.209 effectuates section 510 of the ADA, which clarifies the Act's application to people who use drugs illegally. Paragraph (a) provides that this part does not prohibit discrimination based on an individual's current illegal use of drugs.\n\nThe Act and the regulation distinguish between illegal use of drugs and the legal use of substances, whether or not those substances are \"controlled substances,'' as defined in the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812). Some controlled substances are prescription drugs that have legitimate medical uses. Section 36.209 does not affect use of controlled substances pursuant to a valid prescription, under supervision by a licensed health care professional, or other use that is authorized by the Controlled Substances Act or any other provision of Federal law. It does apply to illegal use of those substances, as well as to illegal use of controlled substances that are not prescription drugs. The key question is whether the individual's use of the substance is illegal, not whether the substance has recognized legal uses. Alcohol is not a controlled substance, so use of alcohol is not addressed by Sec.36.\n\n209. Alcoholics are individuals with disabilities, subject to the protections of the statute.\n\nA distinction is also made between the use of a substance and the status of being addicted to that substance. Addiction is a disability, and addicts are individuals with disabilities protected by the Act. The protection, however, does not extend to actions based on the illegal use of the substance. In other words, an addict cannot use the fact of his or her addiction as a defense to an action based on illegal use of drugs. This distinction is not artificial. Congress intended to deny protection to people who engage in the illegal use of drugs, whether or not they are addicted, but to provide protection to addicts so long as they are not currently using drugs.\n\nA third distinction is the difficult one between current use and former use. The definition of \"current illegal use of drugs'' in Sec.36.104, which is based on the report of the Conference Committee, H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 596, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 64 (1990), is \"illegal use of drugs that occurred recently enough to justify a reasonable belief that a person's drug use is current or that continuing use is a real and ongoing problem.''\n\nParagraph (a)(2)(i) specifies that an individual who has successfully completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully and who is not engaging in current illegal use of drugs is protected. Paragraph (a)(2)(ii) clarifies that an individual who is currently participating in a supervised rehabilitation program and is not engaging in current illegal use of drugs is protected. Paragraph (a)(2)(iii) provides that a person who is erroneously regarded as engaging in current illegal use of drugs, but who is not engaging in such use, is protected.\n\nParagraph (b) provides a limited exception to the exclusion of current illegal users of drugs from the protections of the Act. It prohibits denial of health services, or services provided in connection with drug rehabilitation, to an individual on the basis of current illegal use of drugs, if the individual is otherwise entitled to such services. As explained further in the discussion of Sec.36.302, a health care facility that specializes in a particular type of treatment, such as care of burn victims, is not required to provide drug rehabilitation services, but it cannot refuse to treat an individual's burns on the grounds that the individual is illegally using drugs.\n\nA commenter argued that health care providers should be permitted to use their medical judgment to postpone discretionary medical treatment of individuals under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The regulation permits a medical practitioner to take into account an individual's use of drugs in determining appropriate medical treatment. Section 36.209 provides that the prohibitions on discrimination in this part do not apply when the public accommodation acts on the basis of current illegal use of drugs. Although those prohibitions do apply under paragraph (b), the limitations established under this part also apply. Thus, under Sec.36.208, a health care provider or other public accommodation covered under Sec.36.209(b) may exclude an individual whose current illegal use of drugs poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others, and, under Sec.36.301, a public accommodation may impose or apply eligibility criteria that are necessary for the provision of the services being offered, and may impose legitimate safety requirements that are necessary for safe operation. These same limitations also apply to individuals with disabilities who use alcohol or prescription drugs. The Department believes that these provisions address this commenter's concerns.",

    "content": "The Department believes that these provisions address this commenter's concerns.\n\nOther commenters pointed out that abstention from the use of drugs is an essential condition for participation in some drug rehabilitation programs, and may be a necessary requirement in inpatient or residential settings. The Department believes that this comment is well-founded. Congress clearly did not intend to exclude from drug treatment programs the very individuals who need such programs because of their use of drugs. In such a situation, however, once an individual has been admitted to a program, abstention may be a necessary and appropriate condition to continued participation. The final rule therefore provides that a drug rehabilitation or treatment program may deny participation to individuals who use drugs while they are in the program.\n\nParagraph (c) expresses Congress' intention that the Act be neutral with respect to testing for illegal use of drugs. This paragraph implements the provision in section 510(b) of the Act that allows entities \"to adopt or administer reasonable policies or procedures, including but not limited to drug testing,'' that ensure an individual who is participating in a supervised rehabilitation program, or who has completed such a program or otherwise been rehabilitated successfully, is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs. Paragraph (c) is not to be construed to encourage, prohibit, restrict, or authorize the conducting of testing for the illegal use of drugs.\n\nParagraph (c) of Sec.36.209 clarifies that it is not a violation of this part to adopt or administer reasonable policies or procedures to ensure that an individual who formerly engaged in the illegal use of drugs is not currently engaging in illegal use of drugs. Any such policies or procedures must, of course, be reasonable, and must be designed to identify accurately the illegal use of drugs. This paragraph does not authorize inquiries, tests, or other procedures that would disclose use of substances that are not controlled substances or are taken under supervision by a licensed health care professional, or other uses authorized by the Controlled Substances Act or other provisions of Federal law, because such uses are not included in the definition of \"illegal use of drugs.''\n\nOne commenter argued that the rule should permit testing for lawful use of prescription drugs, but most favored the explanation that tests must be limited to unlawful use in order to avoid revealing the use of prescription medicine used to treat disabilities. Tests revealing legal use of prescription drugs might violate the prohibition in Sec.36.301 of attempts to unnecessarily identify the existence of a disability.\n\nSection 36.210 Smoking\n\nSection 36.210 restates the clarification in section 501(b) of the Act that the Act does not preclude the prohibition of, or imposition of restrictions on, smoking. Some commenters argued that Sec.36.210 does not go far enough, and that the regulation should prohibit smoking in all places of public accommodation. The reference to smoking in section 501 merely clarifies that the Act does not require public accommodations to accommodate smokers by permitting them to smoke in places of public accommodations.\n\nSection 36.211 Maintenance of Accessible Features\n\nSection 36.211 provides that a public accommodation shall maintain in operable working condition those features of facilities and equipment that are required to be readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities by the Act or this part. The Act requires that, to the maximum extent feasible, facilities must be accessible to, and usable by, individuals with disabilities. This section recognizes that it is not sufficient to provide features such as accessible routes, elevators, or ramps, if those features are not maintained in a manner that enables individuals with disabilities to use them. Inoperable elevators, locked accessible doors, or \"accessible'' routes that are obstructed by furniture, filing cabinets, or potted plants are neither \"accessible to'' nor \"usable by'' individuals with disabilities.\n\nSome commenters objected that this section appeared to establish an absolute requirement and suggested that language from the preamble be included in the text of the regulation. It is, of course, impossible to guarantee that mechanical devices will never fail to operate. Paragraph (b) of the final regulation provides that this section does not prohibit isolated or temporary interruptions in service or access due to maintenance or repairs. This paragraph is intended to clarify that temporary obstructions or isolated instances of mechanical failure would not be considered violations of the Act or this part. However, allowing obstructions or \"out of service'' equipment to persist beyond a reasonable period of time would violate this part, as would repeated mechanical failures due to improper or inadequate maintenance. Failure of the public accommodation to ensure that accessible routes are properly maintained and free of obstructions, or failure to arrange prompt repair of inoperable elevators or other equipment intended to provide access, would also violate this part.\n\nOther commenters requested that this section be expanded to include specific requirements for inspection and maintenance of equipment, for training staff in the proper operation of equipment, and for maintenance of specific items. The Department believes that this section properly establishes the general requirement for maintaining access and that further, more detailed requirements are not necessary.\n\nSection 36.212 Insurance\n\nThe Department received numerous comments on proposed Sec.36.\n\n212. Most supported the proposed regulation but felt that it did not go far enough in protecting individuals with disabilities and persons associated with them from discrimination. Many commenters argued that language from the preamble to the proposed regulation should be included in the text of the final regulation. Other commenters argued that even that language was not strong enough, and that more stringent standards should be established. Only a few commenters argued that the Act does not apply to insurance underwriting practices or the terms of insurance contracts. These commenters cited language from the Senate committee report (S. Rep. No. 116, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., at 84 - 86 (1989) (hereinafter \"Senate report'')), indicating that Congress did not intend to affect existing insurance practices.\n\nThe Department has decided to adopt the language of the proposed rule without change. Sections 36.212 (a) and (b) restate section 501(c) of the Act, which provides that the Act shall not be construed to restrict certain insurance practices on the part of insurance companies and employers, as long as such practices are not used to evade the purposes of the Act. Section 36.212(c) is a specific application of Sec.36.202(a), which prohibits denial of participation on the basis of disability. It provides that a public accommodation may not refuse to serve an individual with a disability because of limitations on coverage or rates in its insurance policies (see Judiciary report at 56).",

    "content": "It provides that a public accommodation may not refuse to serve an individual with a disability because of limitations on coverage or rates in its insurance policies (see Judiciary report at 56).\n\nMany commenters supported the requirements of Sec.36.212(c) in the proposed rule because it addressed an important reason for denial of services by public accommodations. One commenter argued that services could be denied if the insurance coverage required exclusion of people whose disabilities were reasonably related to the risks involved in that particular place of public accommodation. Sections 36.208 and 36.301 establish criteria for denial of participation on the basis of legitimate safety concerns. This paragraph does not prohibit consideration of such concerns in insurance policies, but provides that any exclusion on the basis of disability must be based on the permissible criteria, rather than on the terms of the insurance contract.\n\nLanguage in the committee reports indicates that Congress intended to reach insurance practices by prohibiting differential treatment of individuals with disabilities in insurance offered by public accommodations unless the differences are justified. \"Under the ADA, a person with a disability cannot be denied insurance or be subject to different terms or conditions of insurance based on disability alone, if the disability does not pose increased risks'' (Senate report at 84; Education and Labor report at 136). Section 501(c) (1) of the Act was intended to emphasize that \"insurers may continue to sell to and underwrite individuals applying for life, health, or other insurance on an individually underwritten basis, or to service such insurance products, so long as the standards used are based on sound actuarial data and not on speculation'' (Judiciary report at 70 (emphasis added); see also Senate report at 85; Education and Labor report at 137).\n\nThe committee reports indicate that underwriting and classification of risks must be \"based on sound actuarial principles or be related to actual or reasonably anticipated experience'' (see, e.g., Judiciary report at 71). Moreover, \"while a plan which limits certain kinds of coverage based on classification of risk would be allowed * * *, the plan may not refuse to insure, or refuse to continue to insure, or limit the amount, extent, or kind of coverage available to an individual, or charge a different rate for the same coverage solely because of a physical or mental impairment, except where the refusal, limitation, or rate differential is based on sound actuarial principles or is related to actual or reasonably anticipated experience'' (Senate report at 85; Education and Labor report at 136 - 37; Judiciary report at 71). The ADA, therefore, does not prohibit use of legitimate actuarial considerations to justify differential treatment of individuals with disabilities in insurance.\n\nThe committee reports provide some guidance on how nondiscrimination principles in the disability rights area relate to insurance practices. For example, a person who is blind may not be denied coverage based on blindness independent of actuarial risk classification. With respect to group health insurance coverage, an individual with a pre-existing condition may be denied coverage for that condition for the period specified in the policy, but cannot be denied coverage for illness or injuries unrelated to the pre-existing condition. Also, a public accommodation may offer insurance policies that limit coverage for certain procedures or treatments, but may not entirely deny coverage to a person with a disability.\n\nThe Department requested comment on the extent to which data that would establish statistically sound correlations are available. Numerous commenters cited pervasive problems in the availability and cost of insurance for individuals with disabilities and parents of children with disabilities. No commenters cited specific data, or sources of data, to support specific exclusionary practices. Several commenters reported that, even when statistics are available, they are often outdated and do not reflect current medical technology and treatment methods. Concern was expressed that adequate efforts are not made to distinguish those individuals who are high users of health care from individuals in the same diagnostic groups who may be low users of health care. One insurer reported that \"hard data and actuarial statistics are not available to provide precise numerical justifications for every underwriting determination,'' but argued that decisions may be based on \"logical principles generally accepted by actuarial science and fully consistent with state insurance laws.'' The commenter urged that the Department recognize the validity of information other than statistical data as a basis for insurance determinations.\n\nThe most frequent comment was a recommendation that the final regulation should require the insurance company to provide a copy of the actuarial data on which its actions are based when requested by the applicant. Such a requirement would be beyond anything contemplated by the Act or by Congress and has therefore not been included in the Department's final rule. Because the legislative history of the ADA clarifies that different treatment of individuals with disabilities in insurance may be justified by sound actuarial data, such actuarial data will be critical to any potential litigation on this issue. This information would presumably be obtainable in a court proceeding where the insurer's actuarial data was the basis for different treatment of persons with disabilities. In addition, under some State regulatory schemes, insurers may have to file such actuarial information with the State regulatory agency and this information may be obtainable at the State level.\n\nA few commenters representing the insurance industry conceded that underwriting practices in life and health insurance are clearly covered, but argued that property and casualty insurance are not covered. The Department sees no reason for this distinction. Although life and health insurance are the areas where the regulation will have its greatest application, the Act applies equally to unjustified discrimination in all types of insurance provided by public accommodations. A number of commenters, for example, reported difficulties in obtaining automobile insurance because of their disabilities, despite their having good driving records.\n\nSection 36.213 Relationship of Subpart 8 to Subparts C and D\n\nThis section explains that subpart B sets forth the general principles of nondiscrimination applicable to all entities subject to this regulation, while subparts C and D provide guidance on the application of this part to specific situations. The specific provisions in subparts C and D, including the limitations on those provisions, control over the general provisions in circumstances where both specific and general provisions apply. Resort to the general provisions of subpart B is only appropriate where there are no applicable specific rules of guidance in subparts C or D. This interaction between the specific requirements and the general requirements operates with regard to contractual obligations as well.",

    "content": "This interaction between the specific requirements and the general requirements operates with regard to contractual obligations as well.\n\nOne illustration of this principle is its application to the obligation of a public accommodation to provide access to services by removal of architectural barriers or by alternatives to barrier removal. The general requirement, established in subpart B by Sec.36.203, is that a public accommodation must provide its services to individuals with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate. This general requirement would appear to categorically prohibit \"segregated'' seating for persons in wheelchairs. Section 36.304, however, only requires removal of architectural barriers to the extent that removal is \"readily achievable.'' If providing access to all areas of a restaurant, for example, would not be \"readily achievable,'' a public accommodation may provide access to selected areas only. Also, Sec.36.305 provides that, where barrier removal is not readily achievable, a public accommodation may use alternative, readily achievable methods of making services available, such as curbside service or home delivery. Thus, in this manner, the specific requirements of Sec..36.304 and 36.305 control over the general requirement of Sec.36.\n\n203. Subpart C -- Specific Requirements\n\nIn general, subpart C implements the \"specific prohibitions'' that comprise section 302(b)(2) of the ADA. It also addresses the requirements of section 309 of the ADA regarding examinations and courses.\n\nSection 36.301 Eligibility Criteria\n\nSection 36.301 of the rule prohibits the imposition or application of eligibility criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or any class of individuals with disabilities from fully and equally enjoying any goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations, unless such criteria can be shown to be necessary for the provision of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations being offered. This prohibition is based on section 302(b)(2)(A)(i) of the ADA.\n\nIt would violate this section to establish exclusive or segregative eligibility criteria that would bar, for example, all persons who are deaf from playing on a golf course or all individuals with cerebral palsy from attending a movie theater, or limit the seating of individuals with Down's syndrome to only particular areas of a restaurant. The wishes, tastes, or preferences of other customers may not be asserted to justify criteria that would exclude or segregate individuals with disabilities.\n\nSection 36.301 also prohibits attempts by a public accommodation to unnecessarily identify the existence of a disability; for example, it would be a violation of this section for a retail store to require an individual to state on a credit application whether the applicant has epilepsy, mental illness, or any other disability, or to inquire unnecessarily whether an individual has HIV disease.\n\nSection 36.301 also prohibits policies that unnecessarily impose requirements or burdens on individuals with disabilities that are not placed on others. For example, public accommodations may not require that an individual with a disability be accompanied by an attendant. As provided by Sec.36.306, however, a public accommodation is not required to provide services of a personal nature including assistance in toileting, eating, or dressing.\n\nParagraph (c) of Sec.36.301 provides that public accommodations may not place a surcharge on a particular individual with a disability or any group of individuals with disabilities to cover the costs of measures, such as the provision of auxiliary aids and services, barrier removal, alternatives to barrier removal, and reasonable modifications in policies, practices, and procedures, that are required to provide that individual or group with the nondiscriminatory treatment required by the Act or this part.\n\nA number of commenters inquired as to whether deposits required for the use of auxiliary aids, such as assistive listening devices, are prohibited surcharges. It is the Department's view that reasonable, completely refundable, deposits are not to be considered surcharges prohibited by this section. Requiring deposits is an important means of ensuring the availability of equipment necessary to ensure compliance with the ADA.\n\nOther commenters sought clarification as to whether Sec.36.301(c) prohibits professionals from charging for the additional time that it may take in certain cases to provide services to an individual with disabilities. The Department does not intend Sec.36.301(c) to prohibit professionals who bill on the basis of time from charging individuals with disabilities on that basis. However, fees may not be charged for the provision of auxiliary aids and services, barrier removal, alternatives to barrier removal, reasonable modifications in policies, practices, and procedures, or any other measures necessary to ensure compliance with the ADA.\n\nOther commenters inquired as to whether day care centers may charge for extra services provided to individuals with disabilities. As stated above, Sec.36.302(c) is intended only to prohibit charges for measures necessary to achieve compliance with the ADA.\n\nAnother commenter asserted that charges may be assessed for home delivery provided as an alternative to barrier removal under Sec.36.305, when home delivery is provided to all customers for a fee. Charges for home delivery are permissible if home delivery is not considered an alternative to barrier removal. If the public accommodation offers an alternative, such as curb, carry-out, or sidewalk service for which no surcharge is assessed, then it may charge for home delivery in accordance with its standard pricing for home delivery.\n\nIn addition, Sec.36.301 prohibits the imposition of criteria that \"tend to'' screen out an individual with a disability. This concept, which is derived from current regulations under section 504 (see, e.g., 45 CFR 84.13), makes it discriminatory to impose policies or criteria that, while not creating a direct bar to individuals with disabilities, indirectly prevent or limit their ability to participate. For example, requiring presentation of a driver's license as the sole means of identification for purposes of paying by check would violate this section in situations where, for example, individuals with severe vision impairments or developmental disabilities or epilepsy are ineligible to receive a driver's license and the use of an alternative means of identification, such as another photo I.D. or credit card, is feasible.\n\nA public accommodation may, however, impose neutral rules and criteria that screen out, or tend to screen out, individuals with disabilities, if the criteria are necessary for the safe operation of the public accommodation. Examples of safety qualifications that would be justifiable in appropriate circumstances would include height requirements for certain amusement park rides or a requirement that all participants in a recreational rafting expedition be able to meet a necessary level of swimming proficiency. Safety requirements must be based on actual risks and not on speculation, stereotypes, or generalizations about individuals with disabilities.\n\nSection 36.302 Modifications in Policies, Practices, or Procedures\n\nSection 36.302 of the rule prohibits the failure to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, and procedures when such modifications may be necessary to afford any goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations, unless the entity can demonstrate that making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations. This prohibition is based on section 302(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the ADA.",

    "content": "This prohibition is based on section 302(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the ADA.\n\nFor example, a parking facility would be required to modify a rule barring all vans or all vans with raised roofs, if an individual who uses a wheelchair-accessible van wishes to park in that facility, and if overhead structures are high enough to accommodate the height of the van. A department store may need to modify a policy of only permitting one person at a time in a dressing room, if an individual with mental retardation needs and requests assistance in dressing from a companion. Public accommodations may need to revise operational policies to ensure that services are available to individuals with disabilities. For instance, a hotel may need to adopt a policy of keeping an accessible room unoccupied until an individual with a disability arrives at the hotel, assuming the individual has properly reserved the room.\n\nOne example of application of this principle is specifically included in a new Sec.36.302(d) on check-out aisles. That paragraph provides that a store with check-out aisles must ensure that an adequate number of accessible check-out aisles is kept open during store hours, or must otherwise modify its policies and practices, in order to ensure that an equivalent level of convenient service is provided to individuals with disabilities as is provided to others. For example, if only one check-out aisle is accessible, and it is generally used for express service, one way of providing equivalent service is to allow persons with mobility impairments to make all of their purchases at that aisle. This principle also applies with respect to other accessible elements and services. For example, a particular bank may be in compliance with the accessibility guidelines for new construction incorporated in appendix A with respect to automated teller machines (ATM) at a new branch office by providing one accessible walk-up machine at that location, even though an adjacent walk-up ATM is not accessible and the drive-up ATM is not accessible. However, the bank would be in violation of this section if the accessible ATM was located in a lobby that was locked during evening hours while the drive-up ATM was available to customers without disabilities during those same hours. The bank would need to ensure that the accessible ATM was available to customers during the hours that any of the other ATM's was available.\n\nA number of commenters inquired as to the relationship between this section and Sec.36.307, \"Accessible or special goods.'' Under Sec.36.307, a public accommodation is not required to alter its inventory to include accessible or special goods that are designed for, or facilitate use by, individuals with disabilities. The rule enunciated in Sec.36.307 is consistent with the \"fundamental alteration'' defense to the reasonable modifications requirement of Sec.36.\n\n302. Therefore, Sec.36.302 would not require the inventory of goods provided by a public accommodation to be altered to include goods with accessibility features. For example, Sec.36.302 would not require a bookstore to stock Brailled books or order Brailled books, if it does not do so in the normal course of its business.\n\nThe rule does not require modifications to the legitimate areas of specialization of service providers. Section 36.302(b) provides that a public accommodation may refer an individual with a disability to another public accommodation, if that individual is seeking, or requires, treatment or services outside of the referring public accommodation's area of specialization, and if, in the normal course of its operations, the referring public accommodation would make a similar referral for an individual without a disability who seeks or requires the same treatment or services.\n\nFor example, it would not be discriminatory for a physician who specializes only in burn treatment to refer an individual who is deaf to another physician for treatment of an injury other than a burn injury. To require a physician to accept patients outside of his or her specialty would fundamentally alter the nature of the medical practice and, therefore, not be required by this section.\n\nA clinic specializing exclusively in drug rehabilitation could similarly refuse to treat a person who is not a drug addict, but could not refuse to treat a person who is a drug addict simply because the patient tests positive for HIV. Conversely, a clinic that specializes in the treatment of individuals with HIV could refuse to treat an individual that does not have HIV, but could not refuse to treat a person for HIV infection simply because that person is also a drug addict.\n\nSome commenters requested clarification as to how this provision would apply to situations where manifestations of the disability in question, itself, would raise complications requiring the expertise of a different practitioner. It is not the Department's intention in Sec.36.302(b) to prohibit a physician from referring an individual with a disability to another physician, if the disability itself creates specialized complications for the patient's health that the physician lacks the experience or knowledge to address (see Education and Labor report at 106).\n\nSection 36.302(c)(1) requires that a public accommodation modify its policies, practices, or procedures to permit the use of a service animal by an individual with a disability in any area open to the general public. The term \"service animal'' is defined in Sec.36.104 to include guide dogs, signal dogs, or any other animal individually trained to provide assistance to an individual with a disability.\n\nA number of commenters pointed to the difficulty of making the distinction required by the proposed rule between areas open to the general public and those that are not. The ambiguity and uncertainty surrounding these provisions has led the Department to adopt a single standard for all public accommodations.\n\nSection 36.302(c)(1) of the final rule now provides that \"[g]enerally, a public accommodation shall modify policies, practices, and procedures to permit the use of a service animal by an individual with a disability.'' This formulation reflects the general intent of Congress that public accommodations take the necessary steps to accommodate service animals and to ensure that individuals with disabilities are not separated from their service animals. It is intended that the broadest feasible access be provided to service animals in all places of public accommodation, including movie theaters, restaurants, hotels, retail stores, hospitals, and SNFs (see Education and Labor report at 106; Judiciary report at 59). The section also acknowledges, however, that, in rare circumstances, accommodation of service animals may not be required because a fundamental alteration would result in the nature of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, or accommodations offered or provided, or the safe operation of the public accommodation would be jeopardized.\n\nAs specified in Sec.36.302(c)(2), the rule does not require a public accommodation to supervise or care for any service animal. If a service animal must be separated from an individual with a disability in order to avoid a fundamental alteration or a threat to safety, it is the responsibility of the individual with the disability to arrange for the care and supervision of the animal during the period of separation.",

    "content": "If a service animal must be separated from an individual with a disability in order to avoid a fundamental alteration or a threat to safety, it is the responsibility of the individual with the disability to arrange for the care and supervision of the animal during the period of separation.\n\nA museum would not be required by Sec.36.302 to modify a policy barring the touching of delicate works of art in order to enhance the participation of individuals who are blind, if the touching threatened the integrity of the work. Damage to a museum piece would clearly be a fundamental alteration that is not required by this section.\n\nSection 36.303 Auxiliary Aids and Services.\n\nSection 36.303 of the final rule requires a public accommodation to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that no individual with a disability is excluded, denied services, segregated or otherwise treated differently than other individuals because of the absence of auxiliary aids and services, unless the public accommodation can demonstrate that taking such steps would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods, services, facilities, advantages, or accommodations being offered or would result in an undue burden. This requirement is based on section 302(b)(2)(A)(iii) of the ADA.\n\nImplicit in this duty to provide auxiliary aids and services is the underlying obligation of a public accommodation to communicate effectively with its customers, clients, patients, or participants who have disabilities affecting hearing, vision, or speech. To give emphasis to this underlying obligation, Sec.36.303(c) of the rule incorporates language derived from section 504 regulations for federally conducted programs (see e.g., 28 CFR 39.160(a)) that requires that appropriate auxiliary aids and services be furnished to ensure that communication with persons with disabilities is as effective as communication with others.\n\nAuxiliary aids and services include a wide range of services and devices for ensuring effective communication. Use of the most advanced technology is not required so long as effective communication is ensured. The Department's proposed Sec.36.303(b) provided a list of examples of auxiliary aids and services that was taken from the definition of auxiliary aids and services in section 3(1) of the ADA and was supplemented by examples from regulations implementing section 504 in federally conducted programs (see e.g., 28 CFR 39.103). A substantial number of commenters suggested that additional examples be added to this list. The Department has added several items to this list but wishes to clarify that the list is not an all-inclusive or exhaustive catalogue of possible or available auxiliary aids or services. It is not possible to provide an exhaustive list, and such an attempt would omit new devices that will become available with emerging technology.\n\nThe Department has added videotext displays, computer-aided transcription services, and open and closed captioning to the list of examples. Videotext displays have become an important means of accessing auditory communications through a public address system. Transcription services are used to relay aurally delivered material almost simultaneously in written form to persons who are deaf or hard of hearing. This technology is often used at conferences, conventions, and hearings. While the proposed rule expressly included television decoder equipment as an auxiliary aid or service, it did not mention captioning itself. The final rule rectifies this omission by mentioning both closed and open captioning.\n\nIn this section, the Department has changed the proposed rule's phrase, \"orally delivered materials,'' to the phrase, \"aurally delivered materials.'' This new phrase tracks the language in the definition of \"auxiliary aids and services'' in section 3 of the ADA and is meant to include nonverbal sounds and alarms and computer-generated speech.\n\nSeveral persons and organizations requested that the Department replace the term \"telecommunications devices for deaf persons'' or \"TDD's'' with the term \"text telephone.'' The Department has declined to do so. The Department is aware that the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board has used the phrase \"text telephone'' in lieu of the statutory term \"TDD'' in its final accessibility guidelines. Title IV of the ADA, however, uses the term \"Telecommunications Device for the Deaf,'' and the Department believes it would be inappropriate to abandon this statutory term at this time.\n\nParagraph (b)(2) lists examples of aids and services for making visually delivered materials accessible to persons with visual impairments. Many commenters proposed additional examples such as signage or mapping, audio description services, secondary auditory programs (SAP), telebraillers, and reading machines. While the Department declines to add these items to the list in the regulation, they may be considered appropriate auxiliary aids and services.\n\nParagraph (b)(3) refers to the acquisition or modification of equipment or devices. For example, tape players used for an audio-guided tour of a museum exhibit may require the addition of Brailled adhesive labels to the buttons on a reasonable number of the tape players to facilitate their use by individuals who are blind. Similarly, permanent or portable assistive listening systems for persons with hearing impairments may be required at a hotel conference center.\n\nSeveral commenters suggested the addition of current technological innovations in microelectronics and computerized control systems (e.g., voice recognition systems, automatic dialing telephones, and infrared elevator and light control systems) to the list of auxiliary aids and services. The Department interprets auxiliary aids and services as those aids and services designed to provide effective communications, i. e., making aurally and visually delivered information available to persons with hearing, speech, and vision impairments. Methods of making services, programs, or activities accessible to, or usable by, individuals with mobility or manual dexterity impairments are addressed by other sections of this part, including the requirements for modifications in policies, practices, or procedures (Sec.36.302), the elimination of existing architectural barriers (Sec.36.304), and the provision of alternatives to barriers removal (Sec.36.305).\n\nParagraph (b)(4) refers to other similar services and actions. Several commenters asked for clarification that \"similar services and actions'' include retrieving items from shelves, assistance in reaching a marginally accessible seat, pushing a barrier aside in order to provide an accessible route, or assistance in removing a sweater or coat. While retrieving an item from a shelf might be an \"auxiliary aid or service'' for a blind person who could not locate the item without assistance, it might be a readily achievable alternative to barrier removal for a person using a wheelchair who could not reach the shelf, or a reasonable modification to a self-service policy for an individual who lacked the ability to grasp the item. (Of course, a store would not be required to provide a personal shopper.) As explained above, auxiliary aids and services are those aids and services required to provide effective communications. Other forms of assistance are more appropriately addressed by other provisions of the final rule.",

    "content": "Other forms of assistance are more appropriately addressed by other provisions of the final rule.\n\nThe auxiliary aid requirement is a flexible one. A public accommodation can choose among various alternatives as long as the result is effective communication. For example, a restaurant would not be required to provide menus in Braille for patrons who are blind, if the waiters in the restaurant are made available to read the menu. Similarly, a clothing boutique would not be required to have Brailled price tags if sales personnel provide price information orally upon request; and a bookstore would not be required to make available a sign language interpreter, because effective communication can be conducted by notepad.\n\nA critical determination is what constitutes an effective auxiliary aid or service. The Department's proposed rule recommended that, in determining what auxiliary aid to use, the public accommodation consult with an individual before providing him or her with a particular auxiliary aid or service. This suggestion sparked a significant volume of public comment. Many persons with disabilities, particularly persons who are deaf or hard of hearing, recommended that the rule should require that public accommodations give \"primary consideration'' to the \"expressed choice'' of an individual with a disability. These commenters asserted that the proposed rule was inconsistent with congressional intent of the ADA, with the Department's proposed rule implementing title II of the ADA, and with longstanding interpretations of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.\n\nBased upon a careful review of the ADA legislative history, the Department believes that Congress did not intend under title III to impose upon a public accommodation the requirement that it give primary consideration to the request of the individual with a disability. To the contrary, the legislative history demonstrates congressional intent to strongly encourage consulting with persons with disabilities. In its analysis of the ADA's auxiliary aids requirement for public accommodations, the House Education and Labor Committee stated that it \"expects'' that \"public accommodation(s) will consult with the individual with a disability before providing a particular auxiliary aid or service'' (Education and Labor report at 107). Some commenters also cited a different committee statement that used mandatory language as evidence of legislative intent to require primary consideration. However, this statement was made in the context of reasonable accommodations required by title I with respect to employment (Education and Labor report at 67). Thus, the Department finds that strongly encouraging consultation with persons with disabilities, in lieu of mandating primary consideration of their expressed choice, is consistent with congressional intent.\n\nThe Department wishes to emphasize that public accommodations must take steps necessary to ensure that an individual with a disability will not be excluded, denied services, segregated or otherwise treated differently from other individuals because of the use of inappropriate or ineffective auxiliary aids. In those situations requiring an interpreter, the public accommodations must secure the services of a qualified interpreter, unless an undue burden would result.\n\nIn the analysis of Sec.36.303(c) in the proposed rule, the Department gave as an example the situation where a note pad and written materials were insufficient to permit effective communication in a doctor's office when the matter to be decided was whether major surgery was necessary. Many commenters objected to this statement, asserting that it gave the impression that only decisions about major surgery would merit the provision of a sign language interpreter. The statement would, as the commenters also claimed, convey the impression to other public accommodations that written communications would meet the regulatory requirements in all but the most extreme situations. The Department, when using the example of major surgery, did not intend to limit the provision of interpreter services to the most extreme situations.\n\nOther situations may also require the use of interpreters to ensure effective communication depending on the facts of the particular case. It is not difficult to imagine a wide range of communications involving areas such as health, legal matters, and finances that would be sufficiently lengthy or complex to require an interpreter for effective communication. In some situations, an effective alternative to use of a notepad or an interpreter may be the use of a computer terminal upon which the representative of the public accommodation and the customer or client can exchange typewritten messages.\n\nA public accommodation is, however, required to make a TDD available to an individual with impaired hearing or speech, if it customarily offers telephone service to its customers, clients, patients, or participants on more than an incidental convenience basis. Where entry to a place of public accommodation requires use of a security entrance telephone, a TDD or other effective means of communication must be provided for use by an individual with impaired hearing or speech.\n\nIn other words, individual retail stores, doctors' offices, restaurants, or similar establishments are not required by this section to have TDD's, because TDD users will be able to make inquiries, appointments, or reservations with such establishments through the relay system established under title IV of the ADA. The public accommodation will likewise be able to contact TDD users through the relay system. On the other hand, hotels, hospitals, and other similar establishments that offer nondisabled individuals the opportunity to make outgoing telephone calls on more than an incidental convenience basis must provide a TDD on request.\n\nSection 36.303(e) requires places of lodging that provide televisions in five or more guest rooms and hospitals to provide, upon request, a means for decoding closed captions for use by an individual with impaired hearing. Hotels should also provide a TDD or similar device at the front desk in order to take calls from guests who use TDD's in their rooms. In this way guests with hearing impairments can avail themselves of such hotel services as making inquiries of the front desk and ordering room service. The term \"hospital'' is used in its general sense and should be interpreted broadly.\n\nMovie theaters are not required by Sec.36.303 to present open-captioned films. However, other public accommodations that impart verbal information through soundtracks on films, video tapes, or slide shows are required to make such information accessible to persons with hearing impairments. Captioning is one means to make the information accessible to individuals with disabilities.\n\nThe rule specifies that auxiliary aids and services include the acquisition or modification of equipment or devices. For example, tape players used for an audio-guided tour of a museum exhibit may require the addition of Brailled adhesive labels to the buttons on a reasonable number of the tape players to facilitate their use by individuals who are blind. Similarly, a hotel conference center may need to provide permanent or portable assistive listening systems for persons with hearing impairments.",

    "content": "Similarly, a hotel conference center may need to provide permanent or portable assistive listening systems for persons with hearing impairments.\n\nAs provided in Sec.36.303(f), a public accommodation is not required to provide any particular aid or service that would result either in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations offered or in an undue burden. Both of these statutory limitations are derived from existing regulations and caselaw under section 504 and are to be applied on a case-by-case basis (see, e.g., 28 CFR 39.160(d) and Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397 (1979)). Congress intended that \"undue burden'' under Sec.36.303 and \"undue hardship,'' which is used in the employment provisions of title I of the ADA, should be determined on a case-by-case basis under the same standards and in light of the same factors (Judiciary report at 59). The rule, therefore, in accordance with the definition of undue hardship in section 101(10) of the ADA, defines undue burden as \"significant difficulty or expense'' (see Sec..36.104 and 36.303(a)) and requires that undue burden be determined in light of the factors listed in the definition in 36.\n\n104. Consistent with regulations implementing section 504 in federally conducted programs (see, e.g., 28 CFR 39.160(d)), Sec.36.303(f) provides that the fact that the provision of a particular auxiliary aid or service would result in an undue burden does not relieve a public accommodation from the duty to furnish an alternative auxiliary aid or service, if available, that would not result in such a burden.\n\nSection 36.303(g) of the proposed rule has been deleted from this section and included in a new Sec.36.\n\n306. That new section continues to make clear that the auxiliary aids requirement does not mandate the provision of individually prescribed devices, such as prescription eyeglasses or hearing aids.\n\nThe costs of compliance with the requirements of this section may not be financed by surcharges limited to particular individuals with disabilities or any group of individuals with disabilities (Sec.36.301(c)).\n\nSection 36.304 Removal of Barriers\n\nSection 36.304 requires the removal of architectural barriers and communication barriers that are structural in nature in existing facilities, where such removal is readily achievable, i.e., easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense. This requirement is based on section 302(b)(2)(A)(iv) of the ADA.\n\nA number of commenters interpreted the phrase \"communication barriers that are structural in nature'' broadly to encompass the provision of communications devices such as TDD's, telephone handset amplifiers, assistive listening devices, and digital check-out displays. The statute, however, as read by the Department, limits the application of the phrase \"communications barriers that are structural in nature'' to those barriers that are an integral part of the physical structure of a facility. In addition to the communications barriers posed by permanent signage and alarm systems noted by Congress (see Education and Labor report at 110), the Department would also include among the communications barriers covered by Sec.36.304 the failure to provide adequate sound buffers, and the presence of physical partitions that hamper the passage of sound waves between employees and customers. Given that Sec.36.304's proper focus is on the removal of physical barriers, the Department believes that the obligation to provide communications equipment and devices such as TDD's, telephone handset amplifiers, assistive listening devices, and digital check-out displays is more appropriately determined by the requirements for auxiliary aids and services under Sec.36.303 (see Education and Labor report at 107 - 108). The obligation to remove communications barriers that are structural in nature under Sec.36.304, of course, is independent of any obligation to provide auxiliary aids and services under Sec.36.\n\n303. The statutory provision also requires the readily achievable removal of certain barriers in existing vehicles and rail passenger cars. This transportation requirement is not included in Sec.36.304, but rather in Sec.36.310(b) of the rule.\n\nIn striking a balance between guaranteeing access to individuals with disabilities and recognizing the legitimate cost concerns of businesses and other private entities, the ADA establishes different standards for existing facilities and new construction. In existing facilities, which are the subject of Sec.36.304, where retrofitting may prove costly, a less rigorous degree of accessibility is required than in the case of new construction and alterations (see Sec..36.401 - 36.406) where accessibility can be more conveniently and economically incorporated in the initial stages of design and construction.\n\nFor example, a bank with existing automatic teller machines (ATM's) would have to remove barriers to the use of the ATM's, if it is readily achievable to do so. Whether or not it is necessary to take actions such as ramping a few steps or raising or lowering an ATM would be determined by whether the actions can be accomplished easily and without much difficulty or expense.\n\nOn the other hand, a newly constructed bank with ATM's would be required by Sec.36.401 to have an ATM that is \"readily accessible to and usable by'' persons with disabilities in accordance with accessibility guidelines incorporated under Sec.36.\n\n406. The requirement to remove architectural barriers includes the removal of physical barriers of any kind. For example, Sec.36.304 requires the removal, when readily achievable, of barriers caused by the location of temporary or movable structures, such as furniture, equipment, and display racks. In order to provide access to individuals who use wheelchairs, for example, restaurants may need to rearrange tables and chairs, and department stores may need to reconfigure display racks and shelves. As stated in Sec.36.304(f), such actions are not readily achievable to the extent that they would result in a significant loss of selling or serving space. If the widening of all aisles in selling or serving areas is not readily achievable, then selected widening should be undertaken to maximize the amount of merchandise or the number of tables accessible to individuals who use wheelchairs. Access to goods and services provided in any remaining inaccessible areas must be made available through alternative methods to barrier removal, as required by Sec.36.\n\n305. Because the purpose of title III of the ADA is to ensure that public accommodations are accessible to their customers, clients, or patrons (as opposed to their employees, who are the focus of title I), the obligation to remove barriers under Sec.36.304 does not extend to areas of a facility that are used exclusively as employee work areas.\n\nSection 36.304(b) provides a wide-ranging list of the types of modest measures that may be taken to remove barriers and that are likely to be readily achievable. The list includes examples of measures, such as adding raised letter markings on elevator control buttons and installing flashing alarm lights, that would be used to remove communications barriers that are structural in nature. It is not an exhaustive list, but merely an illustrative one. Moreover, the inclusion of a measure on this list does not mean that it is readily achievable in all cases. Whether or not any of these measures is readily achievable is to be determined on a case-by-case basis in light of the particular circumstances presented and the factors listed in the definition of readily achievable (Sec.36.104).",

    "content": "Whether or not any of these measures is readily achievable is to be determined on a case-by-case basis in light of the particular circumstances presented and the factors listed in the definition of readily achievable (Sec.36.104).\n\nA public accommodation generally would not be required to remove a barrier to physical access posed by a flight of steps, if removal would require extensive ramping or an elevator. Ramping a single step, however, will likely be readily achievable, and ramping several steps will in many circumstances also be readily achievable. The readily achievable standard does not require barrier removal that requires extensive restructuring or burdensome expense. Thus, where it is not readily achievable to do, the ADA would not require a restaurant to provide access to a restroom reachable only by a flight of stairs.\n\nLike Sec.36.405, this section permits deference to the national interest in preserving significant historic structures. Barrier removal would not be considered \"readily achievable'' if it would threaten or destroy the historic significance of a building or facility that is eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places under the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470, et seq.), or is designated as historic under State or local law.\n\nThe readily achievable defense requires a less demanding level of exertion by a public accommodation than does the undue burden defense to the auxiliary aids requirements of Sec.36.\n\n303. In that sense, it can be characterized as a \"lower'' standard than the undue burden standard. The readily achievable defense is also less demanding than the undue hardship defense in section 102(b)(5) of the ADA, which limits the obligation to make reasonable accommodation in employment. Barrier removal measures that are not easily accomplishable and are not able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense are not required under the readily achievable standard, even if they do not impose an undue burden or an undue hardship.\n\nSection 36.304(f)(1) of the proposed rule, which stated that \"barrier removal is not readily achievable if it would result in significant loss of profit or significant loss of efficiency of operation,'' has been deleted from the final rule. Many commenters objected to this provision because it impermissibly introduced the notion of profit into a statutory standard that did not include it. Concern was expressed that, in order for an action not to be considered readily achievable, a public accommodation would inappropriately have to show, for example, not only that the action could not be done without \"much difficulty or expense'', but that a significant loss of profit would result as well. In addition, some commenters asserted use of the word \"significant,'' which is used in the definition of undue hardship under title I (the standard for interpreting the meaning of undue burden as a defense to title III's auxiliary aids requirements) (see Sec..36.104, 36.303(f)), blurs the fact that the readily achievable standard requires a lower level of effort on the part of a public accommodation than does the undue burden standard.\n\nThe obligation to engage in readily achievable barrier removal is a continuing one. Over time, barrier removal that initially was not readily achievable may later be required because of changed circumstances. Many commenters expressed support for the Department's position that the obligation to comply with Sec.36.304 is continuing in nature. Some urged that the rule require public accommodations to assess their compliance on at least an annual basis in light of changes in resources and other factors that would be relevant to determining what barrier removal measures would be readily achievable.\n\nAlthough the obligation to engage in readily achievable barrier removal is clearly a continuing duty, the Department has declined to establish any independent requirement for an annual assessment or self-evaluation. It is best left to the public accommodations subject to Sec.36.304 to establish policies to assess compliance that are appropriate to the particular circumstances faced by the wide range of public accommodations covered by the ADA. However, even in the absence of an explicit regulatory requirement for periodic self-evaluations, the Department still urges public accommodations to establish procedures for an ongoing assessment of their compliance with the ADA's barrier removal requirements. The Department recommends that this process include appropriate consultation with individuals with disabilities or organizations representing them. A serious effort at self-assessment and consultation can diminish the threat of litigation and save resources by identifying the most efficient means of providing required access.\n\nThe Department has been asked for guidance on the best means for public accommodations to comply voluntarily with this section. Such information is more appropriately part of the Department's technical assistance effort and will be forthcoming over the next several months. The Department recommends, however, the development of an implementation plan designed to achieve compliance with the ADA's barrier removal requirements before they become effective on 1992-01-26. Such a plan, if appropriately designed and diligently executed, could serve as evidence of a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of Sec.36.\n\n104. In developing an implementation plan for readily achievable barrier removal, a public accommodation should consult with local organizations representing persons with disabilities and solicit their suggestions for cost-effective means of making individual places of public accommodation accessible. Such organizations may also be helpful in allocating scarce resources and establishing priorities. Local associations of businesses may want to encourage this process and serve as the forum for discussions on the local level between disability rights organizations and local businesses.\n\nSection 36.304(c) recommends priorities for public accommodations in removing barriers in existing facilities. Because the resources available for barrier removal may not be adequate to remove all existing barriers at any given time, Sec.36.304(c) suggests priorities for determining which types of barriers should be mitigated or eliminated first. The purpose of these priorities is to facilitate long-term business planning and to maximize, in light of limited resources, the degree of effective access that will result from any given level of expenditure.\n\nAlthough many commenters expressed support for the concept of establishing priorities, a significant number objected to their mandatory nature in the proposed rule. The Department shares the concern of these commenters that mandatory priorities would increase the likelihood of litigation and inappropriately reduce the discretion of public accommodations to determine the most effective mix of barrier removal measures to undertake in particular circumstances. Therefore, in the final rule the priorities are no longer mandatory.\n\nIn response to comments that the priorities failed to address communications issues, the Department wishes to emphasize that the priorities encompass the removal of communications barriers that are structural in nature. It would be counter to the ADA's carefully wrought statutory scheme to include in this provision the wide range of communication devices that are required by the ADA's provisions on auxiliary aids and services. The final rule explicitly includes Brailled and raised letter signage and visual alarms among the examples of steps to remove barriers provided in Sec.36.304(c)(2).",

    "content": "The final rule explicitly includes Brailled and raised letter signage and visual alarms among the examples of steps to remove barriers provided in Sec.36.304(c)(2).\n\nSection 36.304(c)(1) places the highest priority on measures that will enable individuals with disabilities to physically enter a place of public accommodation. This priority on \"getting through the door'' recognizes that providing actual physical access to a facility from public sidewalks, public transportation, or parking is generally preferable to any alternative arrangements in terms of both business efficiency and the dignity of individuals with disabilities.\n\nThe next priority, which is established in Sec.36.304(c)(2), is for measures that provide access to those areas of a place of public accommodation where goods and services are made available to the public. For example, in a hardware store, to the extent that it is readily achievable to do so, individuals with disabilities should be given access not only to assistance at the front desk, but also access, like that available to other customers, to the retail display areas of the store.\n\nThe Department agrees with those commenters who argued that access to the areas where goods and services are provided is generally more important than the provision of restrooms. Therefore, the final rule reverses priorities two and three of the proposed rule in order to give lower priority to accessible restrooms. Consequently, the third priority in the final rule (Sec.36.304(c)(3)) is for measures to provide access to restroom facilities and the last priority is placed on any remaining measures required to remove barriers.\n\nSection 36.304(d) requires that measures taken to remove barriers under Sec.36.304 be subject to subpart D's requirements for alterations (except for the path of travel requirements in Sec.36.403). It only permits deviations from the subpart D requirements when compliance with those requirements is not readily achievable. In such cases, Sec.36.304(d) permits measures to be taken that do not fully comply with the subpart D requirements, so long as the measures do not pose a significant risk to the health or safety of individuals with disabilities or others.\n\nThis approach represents a change from the proposed rule which stated that \"readily achievable'' measures taken solely to remove barriers under Sec.36.304 are exempt from the alterations requirements of subpart D. The intent of the proposed rule was to maximize the flexibility of public accommodations in undertaking barrier removal by allowing deviations from the technical standards of subpart D. It was thought that allowing slight deviations would provide access and release additional resources for expanding the amount of barrier removal that could be obtained under the readily achievable standard.\n\nMany commenters, however, representing both businesses and individuals with disabilities, questioned this approach because of the likelihood that unsafe or ineffective measures would be taken in the absence of the subpart D standards for alterations as a reference point. Some advocated a rule requiring strict compliance with the subpart D standard.\n\nThe Department in the final rule has adopted the view of many commenters that (1) public accommodations should in the first instance be required to comply with the subpart D standards for alterations where it is readily achievable to do so and (2) safe, readily achievable measures must be taken when compliance with the subpart D standards is not readily achievable. Reference to the subpart D standards in this manner will promote certainty and good design at the same time that permitting slight deviations will expand the amount of barrier removal that may be achieved under Sec.36.\n\n304. Because of the inconvenience to individuals with disabilities and the safety problems involved in the use of portable ramps, Sec.36.304(e) permits the use of a portable ramp to comply with Sec.36.304(a) only when installation of a permanent ramp is not readily achievable. In order to promote safety, Sec.36.304(e) requires that due consideration be given to the incorporation of features such as nonslip surfaces, railings, anchoring, and strength of materials in any portable ramp that is used.\n\nTemporary facilities brought in for use at the site of a natural disaster are subject to the barrier removal requirements of Sec.36.\n\n304. A number of commenters requested clarification regarding how to determine when a public accommodation has discharged its obligation to remove barriers in existing facilities. For example, is a hotel required by Sec.36.304 to remove barriers in all of its guest rooms? Or is some lesser percentage adequate? A new paragraph (g) has been added to Sec.36.304 to address this issue. The Department believes that the degree of barrier removal required under Sec.36.304 may be less, but certainly would not be required to exceed, the standards for alterations under the ADA Accessibility Guidelines incorporated by subpart D of this part (ADAAG). The ADA's requirements for readily achievable barrier removal in existing facilities are intended to be substantially less rigorous than those for new construction and alterations. It, therefore, would be obviously inappropriate to require actions under Sec.36.304 that would exceed the ADAAG requirements. Hotels, then, in order to satisfy the requirements of Sec.36.304, would not be required to remove barriers in a higher percentage of rooms than required by ADAAG. If relevant standards for alterations are not provided in ADAAG, then reference should be made to the standards for new construction.\n\nSection 36.305 Alternatives to Barrier Removal\n\nSection 36.305 specifies that where a public accommodation can demonstrate that removal of a barrier is not readily achievable, the public accommodation must make its goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations available through alternative methods, if such methods are readily achievable. This requirement is based on section 302(b)(2)(A)(v) of the ADA.\n\nFor example, if it is not readily achievable for a retail store to raise, lower, or remove shelves or to rearrange display racks to provide accessible aisles, the store must, if readily achievable, provide a clerk or take other alternative measures to retrieve inaccessible merchandise. Similarly, if it is not readily achievable to ramp a long flight of stairs leading to the front door of a restaurant or a pharmacy, the restaurant or the pharmacy must take alternative measures, if readily achievable, such as providing curb service or home delivery. If, within a restaurant, it is not readily achievable to remove physical barriers to a certain section of a restaurant, the restaurant must, where it is readily achievable to do so, offer the same menu in an accessible area of the restaurant.\n\nWhere alternative methods are used to provide access, a public accommodation may not charge an individual with a disability for the costs associated with the alternative method (see Sec.36.301(c)). Further analysis of the issue of charging for alternative measures may be found in the preamble discussion of Sec.36.301(c).\n\nIn some circumstances, because of security considerations, some alternative methods may not be readily achievable. The rule does not require a cashier to leave his or her post to retrieve items for individuals with disabilities, if there are no other employees on duty.\n\nSection 36.305(c) of the proposed rule has been deleted and the requirements have been included in a new Sec.36.\n\n306. That section makes clear that the alternative methods requirement does not mandate the provision of personal devices, such as wheelchairs, or services of a personal nature.",

That section makes clear that the alternative methods requirement does not mandate the provision of personal devices, such as wheelchairs, or services of a personal nature.\n\nIn the final rule, Sec.36.305(c) provides specific requirements regarding alternatives to barrier removal in multiscreen cinemas. In some situations, it may not be readily achievable to remove enough barriers to provide access to all of the theaters of a multiscreen cinema. If that is the case, Sec.36.305(c) requires the cinema to establish a film rotation schedule that provides reasonable access for individuals who use wheelchairs to films being presented by the cinema. It further requires that reasonable notice be provided to the public as to the location and time of accessible showings. Methods for providing notice include appropriate use of the international accessibility symbol in a cinema's print advertising and the addition of accessibility information to a cinema's recorded telephone information line.\n\nSection 36.306 Personal Devices and Services\n\nThe final rule includes a new Sec.36.306, entitled \"Personal devices and services.'' Section 36.306 of the proposed rule, \"Readily achievable and undue burden: Factors to be considered,'' was deleted for the reasons described in the preamble discussion of the definition of the term \"readily achievable'' in Sec.36.\n\n104. In place of Sec..36.303(g) and 36.305(c) of the proposed rule, which addressed the issue of personal devices and services in the contexts of auxiliary aids and alternatives to barrier removal, Sec.36.306 provides a general statement that the regulation does not require the provision of personal devices and services. This section states that a public accommodation is not required to provide its customers, clients, or participants with personal devices, such as wheelchairs; individually prescribed devices, such as prescription eyeglasses or hearing aids; or services of a personal nature including assistance in eating, toileting, or dressing.\n\nThis statement serves as a limitation on all the requirements of the regulation. The personal devices and services limitation was intended to have general application in the proposed rule in all contexts where it was relevant. The final rule, therefore, clarifies, this point by including a general provision that will explicitly apply not just to auxiliary aids and services and alternatives to barrier removal, but across-the-board to include such relevant areas as modifications in policies, practices, and procedures (Sec.36.302) and examinations and courses (Sec.36.309), as well.\n\nThe Department wishes to clarify that measures taken as alternatives to barrier removal, such as retrieving items from shelves or providing curb service or home delivery, are not to be considered personal services. Similarly, minimal actions that may be required as modifications in policies, practices, or procedures under Sec.36.302, such as a waiter's removing the cover from a customer's straw, a kitchen's cutting up food into smaller pieces, or a bank's filling out a deposit slip, are not services of a personal nature within the meaning of Sec.36.\n\n306. (Of course, such modifications may be required under Sec.36.302 only if they are \"reasonable.'') Similarly, this section does not preclude the short-term loan of personal receivers that are part of an assistive listening system.\n\nOf course, if personal services are customarily provided to the customers or clients of a public accommodation, e.g., in a hospital or senior citizen center, then these personal services should also be provided to persons with disabilities using the public accommodation.\n\nSection 36.307 Accessible or Special Goods.\n\nSection 36.307 establishes that the rule does not require a public accommodation to alter its inventory to include accessible or special goods with accessibility features that are designed for, or facilitate use by, individuals with disabilities. As specified in Sec.36.307(c), accessible or special goods include such items as Brailled versions of books, books on audio-cassettes, closed captioned video tapes, special sizes or lines of clothing, and special foods to meet particular dietary needs.\n\nThe purpose of the ADA's public accommodations requirements is to ensure accessibility to the goods offered by a public accommodation, not to alter the nature or mix of goods that the public accommodation has typically provided. In other words, a bookstore, for example, must make its facilities and sales operations accessible to individuals with disabilities, but is not required to stock Brailled or large print books. Similarly, a video store must make its facilities and rental operations accessible, but is not required to stock closed-captioned video tapes. The Department has been made aware, however, that the most recent titles in video-tape rental establishments are, in fact, closed captioned.\n\nAlthough a public accommodation is not required by Sec.36.307(a) to modify its inventory, it is required by Sec.36.307(b), at the request of an individual with disabilities, to order accessible or special goods that it does not customarily maintain in stock if, in the normal course of its operation, it makes special orders for unstocked goods, and if the accessible or special goods can be obtained from a supplier with whom the public accommodation customarily does business. For example, a clothing store would be required to order specially-sized clothing at the request of an individual with a disability, if it customarily makes special orders for clothing that it does not keep in stock, and if the clothing can be obtained from one of the store's customary suppliers.\n\nOne commenter asserted that the proposed rule could be interpreted to require a store to special order accessible or special goods of all types, even if only one type is specially ordered in the normal course of its business. The Department, however, intends for Sec.36.307(b) to require special orders only of those particular types of goods for which a public accommodation normally makes special orders. For example, a book and recording store would not have to specially order Brailled books if, in the normal course of its business, it only specially orders recordings and not books.\n\nSection 36.308 Seating in Assembly Areas.\n\nSection 36.308 establishes specific requirements for removing barriers to physical access in assembly areas, which include such facilities as theaters, concert halls, auditoriums, lecture halls, and conference rooms. This section does not address the provision of auxiliary aids or the removal of communications barriers that are structural in nature. These communications requirements are the focus of other provisions of the regulation (see Sec..36.303 - 36.304).\n\nIndividuals who use wheelchairs historically have been relegated to inferior seating in the back of assembly areas separate from accompanying family members and friends. The provisions of Sec.36.308 are intended to promote integration and equality in seating.\n\nIn some instances it may not be readily achievable for auditoriums or theaters to remove seats to allow individuals with wheelchairs to sit next to accompanying family members or friends. In these situations, the final rule retains the requirement that the public accommodation provide portable chairs or other means to allow the accompanying individuals to sit with the persons in wheelchairs. Persons in wheelchairs should have the same opportunity to enjoy movies, plays, and similar events with their families and friends, just as other patrons do. The final rule specifies that portable chairs or other means to permit family members or companions to sit with individuals who use wheelchairs must be provided only when it is readily achievable to do so.",

    "content": "The final rule specifies that portable chairs or other means to permit family members or companions to sit with individuals who use wheelchairs must be provided only when it is readily achievable to do so.\n\nIn order to facilitate seating of wheelchair users who wish to transfer to existing seating, paragraph (a)(1) of the final rule adds a requirement that, to the extent readily achievable, a reasonable number of seats with removable aisle-side armrests must be provided. Many persons in wheelchairs are able to transfer to existing seating with this relatively minor modification. This solution avoids the potential safety hazard created by the use of portable chairs and fosters integration. The final ADA Accessibility Guidelines incorporated by subpart D (ADAAG) also add a requirement regarding aisle seating that was not in the proposed guidelines. In situations when a person in a wheelchair transfers to existing seating, the public accommodation shall provide assistance in handling the wheelchair of the patron with the disability.\n\nLikewise, consistent vith ADAAG, the final rule adds in Sec.36.308(a)(1)(ii)(B) a requirement that, to the extent readily achievable, wheelchair seating provide lines of sight and choice of admission prices comparable to those for members of the general public.\n\nFinally, because Congress intended that the requirements for barrier removal in existing facilities be substantially less rigorous than those required for new construction and alterations, the final rule clarifies in Sec.36.308(a)(3) that in no event can the requirements for existing facilities be interpreted to exceed the standards for alterations under ADAAG. For example, Sec.4.33 of ADAAG only requires wheelchair spaces to be provided in more than one location when the seating capacity of the assembly area exceeds 300. Therefore, paragraph (a) of Sec.36.308 may not be interpreted to require readily achievable dispersal of wheelchair seating in assembly areas with 300 or fewer seats. Similarly, Sec.4.1.3(19) of ADAAG requires six accessible wheelchair locations in an assembly area with 301 to 500 seats. The reasonable number of wheelchair locations required by paragraph (a), therefore, may be less than six, but may not be interpreted to exceed six.\n\nProposed Section 36.309 Purchase of Furniture and Equipment\n\nSection 36.309 of the proposed rule would have required that newly purchased furniture or equipment made available for use at a place of public accommodation be accessible, to the extent such furniture or equipment is available, unless this requirement would fundamentally alter the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations offered, or would not be readily achievable. Proposed Sec.36.309 has been omitted from the final rule because the Department has determined that its requirements are more properly addressed under other sections, and because there are currently no appropriate accessibility standards addressing many types of furniture and equipment.\n\nSome types of equipment will be required to meet the accessibility requirements of subpart D. For example, ADAAG establishes technical and scoping requirements in new construction and alterations for automated teller machines and telephones. Purchase or modification of equipment is required in certain instances by the provisions in Sec..36.201 and 36.\n\n202. For example, an arcade may need to provide accessible video machines in order to ensure full and equal enjoyment of the facilities and to provide an opportunity to participate in the services and facilities it provides. The barrier removal requirements of Sec.36.304 will apply as well to furniture and equipment (lowering shelves, rearranging furniture, adding Braille labels to a vending machine).\n\nSection 36.309 Examinations and Courses\n\nSection 36.309(a) sets forth the general rule that any private entity that offers examinations or courses related to applications, licensing, certification, or credentialing for secondary or postsecondary education, professional, or trade purposes shall offer such examinations or courses in a place and manner accessible to persons with disabilities or offer alternative accessible arrangements for such individuals.\n\nParagraph (a) restates section 309 of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Section 309 is intended to fill the gap that is created when licensing, certification, and other testing authorities are not covered by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act or title II of the ADA. Any such authority that is covered by section 504, because of the receipt of Federal money, or by title II, because it is a function of a State or local government, must make all of its programs accessible to persons with disabilities, which includes physical access as well as modifications in the way the test is administered, e.g., extended time, written instructions, or assistance of a reader.\n\nMany licensing, certification, and testing authorities are not covered by section 504, because no Federal money is received; nor are they covered by title II of the ADA because they are not State or local agencies. However, States often require the licenses provided by such authorities in order for an individual to practice a particular profession or trade. Thus, the provision was included in the ADA in order to assure that persons with disabilities are not foreclosed from educational, professional, or trade opportunities because an examination or course is conducted in an inaccessible site or without needed modifications.\n\nAs indicated in the \"Application'' section of this part (Sec.36.102), Sec.36.309 applies to any private entity that offers the specified types of examinations or courses. This is consistent with section 309 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which states that the requirements apply to \"any person'' offering examinations or courses.\n\nThe Department received a large number of comments on this section, reflecting the importance of ensuring that the key gateways to education and employment are open to individuals with disabilities. The most frequent comments were objections to the fundamental alteration and undue burden provisions in Sec..36.309 (b)(3) and (c)(3) and to allowing courses and examinations to be provided through alternative accessible arrangements, rather than in an integrated setting.\n\nAlthough section 309 of the Act does not refer to a fundamental alteration or undue burden limitation, those limitations do appear in section 302(b)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, which establishes the obligation of public accommodations to provide auxiliary aids and services. The Department, therefore, included it in the paragraphs of Sec.36.309 requiring the provision of auxiliary aids. One commenter argued that similar limitations should apply to all of the requirements of Sec.36.309, but the Department did not consider this extension appropriate.\n\nCommenters who objected to permitting \"alternative accessible arrangements'' argued that such arrangements allow segregation and should not be permitted, unless they are the least restrictive available alternative, for example, for someone who cannot leave home. Some commenters made a distinction between courses, where interaction is an important part of the educational experience, and examinations, where it may be less important. Because the statute specifically authorizes alternative accessible arrangements as a method of meeting the requirements of section 309, the Department has not adopted this suggestion. The Department notes, however, that, while examinations of the type covered by Sec.36.309 may not be covered elsewhere in the regulation, courses will generally be offered in a \"place of education,'' which is included in the definition of \"place of public accommodation'' in Sec.36.104, and, therefore, will be subject to the integrated setting requirement of Sec.36.",

Section 36.309(b) sets forth specific requirements for examinations. Examinations covered by this section would include a bar exam or the Scholastic Aptitude Test prepared by the Educational Testing Service. Paragraph (b)(1) is adopted from the Department of Education's section 504 regulation on admission tests to postsecondary educational programs (34 CFR 104.42(b)(3)). Paragraph (b)(1)(i) requires that a private entity offering an examination covered by the section must assure that the examination is selected and administered so as to best ensure that the examination accurately reflects an individual's aptitude or achievement level or other factor the examination purports to measure, rather than reflecting the individual's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the examination purports to measure).\n\nParagraph (b)(1)(ii) requires that any examination specially designed for individuals with disabilities be offered as often and in as timely a manner as other examinations. Some commenters noted that persons with disabilities may be required to travel long distances when the locations for examinations for individuals with disabilities are limited, for example, to only one city in a State instead of a variety of cities. The Department has therefore revised this paragraph to add a requirement that such examinations be offered at locations that are as convenient as the location of other examinations.\n\nCommenters representing organizations that administer tests wanted to be able to require individuals with disabilities to provide advance notice and appropriate documentation, at the applicants' expense, of their disabilities and of any modifications or aids that would be required. The Department agrees that such requirements are permissible, provided that they are not unreasonable and that the deadline for such notice is no earlier than the deadline for others applying to take the examination. Requiring individuals with disabilities to file earlier applications would violate the requirement that examinations designed for individuals with disabilities be offered in as timely a manner as other examinations.\n\nExaminers may require evidence that an applicant is entitled to modifications or aids as required by this section, but requests for documentation must be reasonable and must be limited to the need for the modification or aid requested. Appropriate documentation might include a letter from a physician or other professional, or evidence of a prior diagnosis or accommodation, such as eligibility for a special education program. The applicant may be required to bear the cost of providing such documentation, but the entity administering the examination cannot charge the applicant for the cost of any modifications or auxiliary aids, such as interpreters, provided for the examination.\n\nParagraph (b)(1)(iii) requires that examinations be administered in facilities that are accessible to individuals with disabilities or alternative accessible arrangements are made.\n\nParagraph (b)(2) gives examples of modifications to examinations that may be necessary in order to comply with this section. These may include providing more time for completion of the examination or a change in the manner of giving the examination, e.g., reading the examination to the individual.\n\nParagraph (b)(3) requires the provision of auxiliary aids and services, unless the private entity offering the examination can demonstrate that offering a particular auxiliary aid would fundamentally alter the examination or result in an undue burden. Examples of auxiliary aids include taped examinations, interpreters or other effective methods of making aurally delivered materials available to individuals with hearing impairments, readers for individuals with visual impairments or learning disabilities, and other similar services and actions. The suggestion that individuals with learning disabilities may need readers is included, although it does not appear in the Department of Education regulation, because, in fact, some individuals with learning disabilities have visual perception problems and would benefit from a reader.\n\nMany commenters pointed out the importance of ensuring that modifications provide the individual with a disability an equal opportunity to demonstrate his or her knowledge or ability. For example, a reader who is unskilled or lacks knowledge of specific terminology used in the examination may be unable to convey the information in the questions or to follow the applicant's instructions effectively. Commenters pointed out that, for persons with visual impairments who read Braille, Braille provides the closest functional equivalent to a printed test. The Department has, therefore, added Brailled examinations to the examples of auxiliary aids and services that may be required. For similar reasons, the Department also added to the list of examples of auxiliary aids and services large print examinations and answer sheets; \"qualified'' readers; and transcribers to write answers.\n\nA commenter suggested that the phrase \"fundamentally alter the examination'' in this paragraph of the proposed rule be revised to more accurately reflect the function affected. In the final rule the Department has substituted the phrase \"fundamentally alter the measurement of the skills or knowledge the examination is intended to test.''\n\nParagraph (b)(4) gives examples of alternative accessible arrangements. For instance, the private entity might be required to provide the examination at an individual's home with a proctor. Alternative arrangements must provide conditions for individuals with disabilities that are comparable to the conditions under which other individuals take the examinations. In other words, an examination cannot be offered to an individual with a disability in a cold, poorly lit basement, if other individuals are given the examination in a warm, well lit classroom.\n\nSome commenters who provide examinations for licensing or certification for particular occupations or professions urged that they be permitted to refuse to provide modifications or aids for persons seeking to take the examinations if those individuals, because of their disabilities, would be unable to perform the essential functions of the profession or occupation for which the examination is given, or unless the disability is reasonably determined in advance as not being an obstacle to certification. The Department has not changed its rule based on this comment. An examination is one stage of a licensing or certification process. An individual should not be barred from attempting to pass that stage of the process merely because he or she might be unable to meet other requirements of the process. If the examination is not the first stage of the qualification process, an applicant may be required to complete the earlier stages prior to being admitted to the examination. On the other hand, the applicant may not be denied admission to the examination on the basis of doubts about his or her abilities to meet requirements that the examination is not designed to test.",

    "content": "On the other hand, the applicant may not be denied admission to the examination on the basis of doubts about his or her abilities to meet requirements that the examination is not designed to test.\n\nParagraph (c) sets forth specific requirements for courses. Paragraph (c)(1) contains the general rule that any course covered by this section must be modified to ensure that the place and manner in which the course is given is accessible. Paragraph (c)(2) gives examples of possible modifications that might be required, including extending the time permitted for completion of the course, permitting oral rather than written delivery of an assignment by a person with a visual impairment, or adapting the manner in which the course is conducted (i.e., providing cassettes of class handouts to an individual with a visual impairment). In response to comments, the Department has added to the examples in paragraph (c)(2) specific reference to distribution of course materials. If course materials are published and available from other sources, the entity offering the course may give advance notice of what materials will be used so as to allow an individual to obtain them in Braille or on tape but materials provided by the course offerer must be made available in alternative formats for individuals with disabilities.\n\nIn language similar to that of paragraph (b), paragraph (c)(3) requires auxiliary aids and services, unless a fundamental alteration or undue burden would result, and paragraph (c)(4) requires that courses be administered in accessible facilities. Paragraph (c)(5) gives examples of alternative accessible arrangements. These may include provision of the course through videotape, cassettes, or prepared notes. Alternative arrangements must provide comparable conditions to those provided to others, including similar lighting, room temperature, and the like. An entity offering a variety of courses, to fulfill continuing education requirements for a profession, for example, may not limit the selection or choice of courses available to individuals with disabilities.\n\nSection 36.310 Transportation Provided by Public Accommodations\n\nSection 36.310 contains specific provisions relating to public accommodations that provide transportation to their clients or customers. This section has been substantially revised in order to coordinate the requirements of this section with the requirements applicable to these transportation systems that will be contained in the regulations issued by the Secretary of Transportation pursuant to section 306 of the ADA, to be codified at 49 CFR part 37. The Department notes that, although the responsibility for issuing regulations applicable to transportation systems operated by public accommodations is divided between this Department and the Department of - Transportation, enforcement authority is assigned only to the Department of Justice.\n\nThe Department received relatively few comments on this section of the proposed rule. Most of the comments addressed issues that are not specifically addressed in this part, such as the standards for accessible vehicles and the procedure for determining whether equivalent service is provided. Those standards will be contained in the regulation issued by the Department of Transportation. Other commenters raised questions about the types of transportation that will be subject to this section. In response to these inquiries, the Department has revised the list of examples contained in the regulation.\n\nParagraph (a)(1) states the general rule that covered public accommodations are subject to all of the specific provisions of subparts B, C, and D, except as provided in Sec.36.\n\n310. Examples of operations covered by the requirements are listed in paragraph (a)(2). The stated examples include hotel and motel airport shuttle services, customer shuttle bus services operated by private companies and shopping centers, student transportation, and shuttle operations of recreational facilities such as stadiums, zoos, amusement parks, and ski resorts. This brief list is not exhaustive. The section applies to any fixed route or demand responsive transportation system operated by a public accommodation for the benefit of its clients or customers. The section does not apply to transportation services provided only to employees. Employee transportation will be subject to the regulations issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to implement title I of the Act. However, if employees and customers or clients are served by the same transportation system, the provisions of this section will apply.\n\nParagraph (b) specifically provides that a public accommodation shall remove transportation barriers in existing vehicles to the extent that it is readily achievable to do so, but that the installation of hydraulic or other lifts is not required.\n\nParagraph (c) provides that public accommodations subject to this section shall comply with the requirements for transportation vehicles and systems contained in the regulations issued by the Secretary of Transportation.\n\nSubpart D -- New Construction and Alterations\n\nSubpart D implements section 303 of the Act, which requires that newly constructed or altered places of public accommodation or commercial facilities be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. This requirement contemplates a high degree of convenient access. It is intended to ensure that patrons and employees of places of public accommodation and employees of commercial facilities are able to get to, enter, and use the facility.\n\nPotential patrons of places of public accommodation, such as retail establishments, should be able to get to a store, get into the store, and get to the areas where goods are being provided. Employees should have the same types of access, although those individuals require access to and around the employment area as well as to the area in which goods and services are provided.\n\nThe ADA is geared to the future -- its goal being that, over time, access will be the rule, rather than the exception. Thus, the Act only requires modest expenditures, of the type addressed in Sec.36.304 of this part, to provide access to existing facilities not otherwise being altered, but requires all new construction and alterations to be accessible.\n\nThe Act does not require new construction or alterations; it simply requires that, when a public accommodation or other private entity undertakes the construction or alteration of a facility subject to the Act, the newly constructed or altered facility must be made accessible. This subpart establishes the requirements for new construction and alterations.\n\nAs explained under the discussion of the definition of \"facility,'' Sec.36.104, pending development of specific requirements, the Department will not apply this subpart to places of public accommodation located in mobile units, boats, or other conveyances.\n\nSection 36.401 New Construction\n\nGeneral\n\nSection 36.401 implements the new construction requirements of the ADA. Section 303 (a)(1) of the Act provides that discrimination for purposes of section 302(a) of the Act includes a failure to design and construct facilities for first occupancy later than 30 months after the date of enactment (i.e., after 1993-01-26) that are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.",

    "content": "Section 303 (a)(1) of the Act provides that discrimination for purposes of section 302(a) of the Act includes a failure to design and construct facilities for first occupancy later than 30 months after the date of enactment (i.e., after 1993-01-26) that are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.\n\nParagraph 36.401(a)(1) restates the general requirement for accessible new construction. The proposed rule stated that \"any public accommodation or other private entity responsible for design and construction'' must ensure that facilities conform to this requirement. Various commenters suggested that the proposed language was not consistent with the statute because it substituted \"private entity responsible for design and construction'' for the statutory language; because it did not address liability on the part of architects, contractors, developers, tenants, owners, and other entities; and because it limited the liability of entities responsible for commercial facilities. In response, the Department has revised this paragraph to repeat the language of section 303(a) of the ADA. The Department will interpret this section in a manner consistent with the intent of the statute and with the nature of the responsibilities of the various entities for design, for construction, or for both.\n\nDesigned and Constructed for First Occupancy\n\nAccording to paragraph (a)(2), a facility is subject to the new construction requirements only if a completed application for a building permit or permit extension is filed after 1992-01-26, and the facility is occupied after 1993-01-26.\n\nThe proposed rule set forth for comment two alternative ways by which to determine what facilities are subject to the Act and what standards apply. Paragraph (a)(2) of the final rule is a slight variation on Option One in the proposed rule. The reasons for the Department's choice of Option One are discussed later in this section.\n\nParagraph (a)(2) acknowledges that Congress did not contemplate having actual occupancy be the sole trigger for the accessibility requirements, because the statute prohibits a failure to \"design and construct for first occupancy,'' rather than requiring accessibility in facilities actually occupied after a particular date.\n\nThe commenters overwhelmingly agreed with the Department's proposal to use a date certain; many cited the reasons given in the preamble to the proposed rule. First, it is helpful for designers and builders to have a fixed date for accessible design, so that they can determine accessibility requirements early in the planning and design stage. It is difficult to determine accessibility requirements in anticipation of the actual date of first occupancy because of unpredictable and uncontrollable events (e.g., strikes affecting suppliers or labor, or natural disasters) that may delay occupancy. To redesign or reconstruct portions of a facility if it begins to appear that occupancy will be later than anticipated would be quite costly. A fixed date also assists those responsible for enforcing, or monitoring compliance with, the statute, and those protected by it.\n\nThe Department considered using as a trigger date for application of the accessibility standards the date on which a permit is granted. The Department chose instead the date on which a complete permit application is certified as received by the appropriate government entity. Almost all commenters agreed with this choice of a trigger date. This decision is based partly on information that several months or even years can pass between application for a permit and receipt of a permit. Design is virtually complete at the time an application is complete (i.e., certified to contain all the information required by the State, county, or local government). After an application is filed, delays may occur before the permit is granted due to numerous factors (not necessarily relating to accessibility): for example, hazardous waste discovered on the property, flood plain requirements, zoning disputes, or opposition to the project from various groups. These factors should not require redesign for accessibility if the application was completed before 1992-01-26. However, if the facility must be redesigned for other reasons, such as a change in density or environmental preservation, and the final permit is based on a new application, the rule would require accessibility if that application was certified complete after 1992-01-26.\n\nThe certification of receipt of a complete application for a building permit is an appropriate point in the process because certifications are issued in writing by governmental authorities. In addition, this approach presents a clear and objective standard.\n\nHowever, a few commenters pointed out that in some jurisdictions it is not possible to receive a \"certification'' that an application is complete, and suggested that in those cases the fixed date should be the date on which an application for a permit is received by the government agency. The Department has included such a provision in Sec.36.401(a)(2)(i).\n\nThe date of 1992-01-26, is relevant only with respect to the last application for a permit or permit extension for a facility. Thus, if an entity has applied for only a \"foundation'' permit, the date of that permit application has no effect, because the entity must also apply for and receive a permit at a later date for the actual superstructure. In this case, it is the date of the later application that would control, unless construction is not completed within the time allowed by the permit, in which case a third permit would be issued and the date of the application for that permit would be determinative for purposes of the rule.\n\nChoice of Option One for Defining \"Designed and Constructed for First Occupancy''\n\nUnder the option the Department has chosen for determining applicability of the new construction standards, a building would be considered to be \"for first occupancy'' after 1993-01-26, only (1) if the last application for a building permit or permit extension for the facility is certified to be complete (or, in some jurisdictions, received) by a State, county, or local government after 1992-01-26, and (2) if the first certificate of occupancy is issued after 1993-01-26. The Department also asked for comment on an Option Two, which would have imposed new construction requirements if a completed application for a building permit or permit extension was filed after the enactment of the ADA (1990-07-26), and the facility was occupied after 1993-01-26.\n\nThe request for comment on this issue drew a large number of comments expressing a wide range of views. Most business groups and some disability rights groups favored Option One, and some business groups and most disability rights groups favored Option Two. Individuals and government entities were equally divided; several commenters proposed other options.",

    "content": "Individuals and government entities were equally divided; several commenters proposed other options.\n\nThose favoring Option One pointed out that it is more reasonable in that it allows time for those subject to the new construction requirements to anticipate those requirements and to receive technical assistance pursuant to the Act. Numerous commenters said that time frames for designing and constructing some types of facilities (for example, health care facilities) can range from two to four years or more. They expressed concerns that Option Two, which would apply to some facilities already under design or construction as of the date the Act was signed, and to some on which construction began shortly after enactment, could result in costly redesign or reconstruction of those facilities. In the same vein, some Option One supporters found Option Two objectionable on due process grounds. In their view, Option Two would mean that in July 1991 (upon issuance of the final DOJ rule) the responsible entities would learn that ADA standards had been in effect since 1990-07-26, and this would amount to retroactive application of standards. Numerous commenters characterized Option Two as having no support in the statute and Option One as being more consistent with congressional intent.\n\nThose who favored Option Two pointed out that it would include more facilities within the coverage of the new construction standards. They argued that because similar accessibility requirements are in effect under State laws, no hardship would be imposed by this option. Numerous commenters said that hardship would also be eliminated in light of their view that the ADA requires compliance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) until issuance of DOJ standards. Those supporting Option Two claimed that it was more consistent with the statute and its legislative history.\n\nThe Department has chosen Option One rather than Option Two, primarily on the basis of the language of three relevant sections of the statute. First, section 303(a) requires compliance with accessibility standards set forth, or incorporated by reference in, regulations to be issued by the Department of Justice. Standing alone, this section cannot be read to require compliance with the Department's standards before those standards are issued (through this rulemaking). Second, according to section 310 of the statute, section 303 becomes effective on 1992-01-26. Thus, section 303 cannot impose requirements on the design of buildings before that date. Third, while section 306(d) of the Act requires compliance with UFAS if final regulations have not been issued, that provision cannot reasonably be read to take effect until 1991-07-26, the date by which the Department of Justice must issue final regulations under title III.\n\nOption Two was based on the premise that the interim standards in section 306(d) take effect as of the ADA's enactment (1990-07-26), rather than on the date by which the Department of Justice regulations are due to be issued (1991-07-26). The initial clause of section 306(d)(1) itself is silent on this question:\n\nIf final regulations have not been issued pursuant to this section, for new construction for which a * * * building permit is obtained prior to the issuance of final regulations * * * (interim standards apply).\n\nThe approach in Option Two relies partly on the language of section 310 of the Act, which provides that section 306, the interim standards provision, takes effect on the date of enactment. Under this interpretation the interim standards provision would prevail over the operative provision, section 303, which requires that new construction be accessible and which becomes effective 1992-01-26. This approach would also require construing the language of section 306(d)(1) to take effect before the Department's standards are due to be issued. The preferred reading of section 306 is that it would require that, if the Department's final standards had not been issued by 1991-07-26, UFAS would apply to certain buildings until such time as the Department's standards were issued.\n\nGeneral Substantive Requirements of the New Construction Provisions\n\nThe rule requires, as does the statute, that covered newly constructed facilities be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. The phrase \"readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities'' is a term that, in slightly varied formulations, has been used in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, the Fair Housing Act, the regulations implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and current accessibility standards. It means, with respect to a facility or a portion of a facility, that it can be approached, entered, and used by individuals with disabilities (including mobility, sensory, and cognitive impairments) easily and conveniently. A facility that is constructed to meet the requirements of the rule's accessibility standards will be considered readily accessible and usable with respect to construction. To the extent that a particular type or element of a facility is not specifically addressed by the standards, the language of this section is the safest guide.\n\nA private entity that renders an \"accessible'' building inaccessible in its operation, through policies or practices, may be in violation of section 302 of the Act. For example, a private entity can render an entrance to a facility inaccessible by keeping an accessible entrance open only during certain hours (whereas the facility is available to others for a greater length of time). A facility could similarly be rendered inaccessible if a person with disabilities is significantly limited in her or his choice of a range of accommodations.\n\nEnsuring access to a newly constructed facility will include providing access to the facility from the street or parking lot, to the extent the responsible entity has control over the route from those locations. In some cases, the private entity will have no control over access at the point where streets, curbs, or sidewalks already exist, and in those instances the entity is encouraged to request modifications to a sidewalk, including installation of curb cuts, from a public entity responsible for them. However, as some commenters pointed out, there is no obligation for a private entity subject to title III of the ADA to seek or ensure compliance by a public entity with title II. Thus, although a locality may have an obligation under title II of the Act to install curb cuts at a particular location, that responsibility is separate from the private entity's title III obligation, and any involvement by a private entity in seeking cooperation from a public entity is purely voluntary in this context.\n\nWork Areas\n\nProposed paragraph 36.401(b) addressed access to employment areas, rather than to the areas where goods or services are being provided. The preamble noted that the proposed paragraph provided guidance for new construction and alterations until more specific guidance was issued by the ATBCB and reflected in this Department's regulation. The entire paragraph has been deleted from this section in the final rule. The concepts of paragraphs (b) (1), (2), and (5) of the proposed rule are included, with modifications and expansion, in ADAAG. Paragraphs (3) and (4) of the proposed rule, concerning fixtures and equipment, are not included in the rule or in ADAAG.",

    "content": "Paragraphs (3) and (4) of the proposed rule, concerning fixtures and equipment, are not included in the rule or in ADAAG.\n\nSome commenters asserted that questions relating to new construction and alterations of work areas should be addressed by the EEOC under title I, as employment concerns. However, the legislative history of the statute clearly indicates that the new construction and alterations requirements of title III were intended to ensure accessibility of new facilities to all individuals, including employees. The language of section 303 sweeps broadly in its application to all public accommodations and commercial facilities. EEOC's title I regulations will address accessibility requirements that come into play when \"reasonable accommodation'' to individual employees or applicants with disabilities is mandated under title I.\n\nThe issues dealt with in proposed Sec.36.401(b) (1) and (2) are now addressed in ADAAG section 4.1.1(3). The Department's proposed paragraphs would have required that areas that will be used only by employees as work stations be constructed so that individuals with disabilities could approach, enter, and exit the areas. They would not have required that all individual work stations be constructed or equipped (for example, with shelves that are accessible or adaptable) to be accessible. This approach was based on the theory that, as long as an employee with disabilities could enter the building and get to and around the employment area, modifications in a particular work station could be instituted as a \"reasonable accommodation'' to that employee if the modifications were necessary and they did not constitute an undue hardship.\n\nAlmost all of the commenters agreed with the proposal to require access to a work area but not to require accessibility of each individual work station. This principle is included in ADAAG 4.1.1(3). Several of the comments related to the requirements of the proposed ADAAG and have been addressed in the accessibility standards.\n\nProposed paragraphs (b) (3) and (4) would have required that consideration be given to placing fixtures and equipment at accessible heights in the first instance, and to purchasing new equipment and fixtures that are adjustable. These paragraphs have not been included in the final rule because the rule in most instances does not establish accessibility standards for purchased equipment. (See discussion elsewhere in the preamble of proposed Sec.36.309.) While the Department encourages entities to consider providing accessible or adjustable fixtures and equipment for employees, this rule does not require them to do so.\n\nParagraph (b)(5) of proposed Sec.36.401 clarified that proposed paragraph (b) did not limit the requirement that employee areas other than individual work stations must be accessible. For example, areas that are employee \"common use'' areas and are not solely used as work stations (e.g., employee lounges, cafeterias, health units, exercise facilities) are treated no differently under this regulation than other parts of a building; they must be constructed or altered in compliance with the accessibility standards. This principle is not stated in Sec.36.401 but is implicit in the requirements of this section and ADAAG.\n\nCommercial Facilities in Private Residences\n\nSection 36.401(b) of the final rule is a new provision relating to commercial facilities located in private residences. The proposed rule addressed these requirements in the preamble to Sec.36.207, \"Places of public accommodation located in private residences.'' The preamble stated that the approach for commercial facilities would be the same as that for places of public accommodation, i.e., those portions used exclusively as a commercial facility or used as both a commercial facility and for residential purposes would be covered. Because commercial facilities are only subject to new construction and alterations requirements, however, the covered portions would only be subject to subpart D. This approach is reflected in Sec.36.401(b)(1).\n\nThe Department is aware that the statutory definition of \"commercial facility'' excludes private residences because they are \"expressly exempted from coverage under the Fair Housing Act of 1968, as amended.'' However, the Department interprets that exemption as applying only to facilities that are exclusively residential. When a facility is used as both a residence and a commercial facility, the exemption does not apply.\n\nParagraph (b)(2) is similar to the new paragraph (b) under Sec.36.207, \"Places of public accommodation located in private residences.'' The paragraph clarifies that the covered portion includes not only the space used as a commercial facility, but also the elements used to enter the commercial facility, e.g., the homeowner's front sidewalk, if any; the doorway; the hallways; the restroom, if used by employees or visitors of the commercial facility; and any other portion of the residence, interior or exterior, used by employees or visitors of the commercial facility.\n\nAs in the case of public accommodations located in private residences, the new construction standards only apply to the extent that a portion of the residence is designed or intended for use as a commercial facility. Likewise, if a homeowner alters a portion of his home to convert it to a commercial facility, that work must be done in compliance with the alterations standards in appendix A.\n\nStructural Impracticability\n\nProposed Sec.36.401(c) is included in the final rule with minor changes. It details a statutory exception to the new construction requirement: the requirement that new construction be accessible does not apply where an entity can demonstrate that it is structurally impracticable to meet the requirements of the regulation. This provision is also included in ADAAG, at section 4.1.1(5)(a).\n\nConsistent with the legislative history of the ADA, this narrow exception will apply only in rare and unusual circumstances where unique characteristics of terrain make accessibility unusually difficult. Such limitations for topographical problems are analogous to an acknowledged limitation in the application of the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) of 1988.\n\nAlmost all commenters supported this interpretation. Two commenters argued that the DOJ requirement is too limiting and would not exempt some buildings that should be exempted because of soil conditions, terrain, and other unusual site conditions. These commenters suggested consistency with HUD's Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines (56 FR 9472 (1991)), which generally would allow exceptions from accessibility requirements, or allow compliance with less stringent requirements, on sites with slopes exceeding 10%.\n\nThe Department is aware of the provisions in HUD's guidelines, which were issued on 1991-03-06, after passage of the ADA and publication of the Department's proposed rule. The approach taken in these guidelines, which apply to different types of construction and implement different statutory requirements for new construction, does not bind this Department in regulating under the ADA. The Department has included in the final rule the substance of the proposed provision, which is faithful to the intent of the statute, as expressed in the legislative history. (See Senate report at 70 - 71; Education and Labor report at 120.)\n\nThe limited structural impracticability exception means that it is acceptable to deviate from accessibility requirements only where unique characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility features and where providing accessibility would destroy the physical integrity of a facility. A situation in which a building must be built on stilts because of its location in marshlands or over water is an example of one of the few situations in which the exception for structural impracticability would apply.",

    "content": "A situation in which a building must be built on stilts because of its location in marshlands or over water is an example of one of the few situations in which the exception for structural impracticability would apply.\n\nThis exception to accessibility requirements should not be applied to situations in which a facility is located in \"hilly'' terrain or on a plot of land upon which there are steep grades. In such circumstances, accessibility can be achieved without destroying the physical integrity of a structure, and is required in the construction of new facilities.\n\nSome commenters asked for clarification concerning when and how to apply the ADA rules or the Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines, especially when a facility may be subject to both because of mixed use. Guidance on this question is provided in the discussion of the definitions of place of public accommodation and commercial facility. With respect to the structural impracticability exception, a mixed-use facility could not take advantage of the Fair Housing exemption, to the extent that it is less stringent than the ADA exemption, except for those portions of the facility that are subject only to the Fair Housing Act.\n\nAs explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, in those rare circumstances in which it is structurally impracticable to achieve full compliance with accessibility retirements under the ADA, places of public accommodation and commercial facilities should still be designed and constructed to incorporate accessibility features to the extent that the features are structurally practicable. The accessibility requirements should not be viewed as an all-or-nothing proposition in such circumstances.\n\nIf it is structurally impracticable for a facility in its entirety to be readily accessible to and usable by people with disabilities, then those portions that can be made accessible should be made accessible. If a building cannot be constructed in compliance with the full range of accessibility requirements because of structural impracticability, then it should still incorporate those features that are structurally practicable. If it is structurally impracticable to make a particular facility accessible to persons who have particular types of disabilities, it is still appropriate to require it to be made accessible to persons with other types of disabilities. For example, a facility that is of necessity built on stilts and cannot be made accessible to persons who use wheelchairs because it is structurally impracticable to do so, must be made accessible for individuals with vision or hearing impairments or other kinds of disabilities.\n\nElevator Exemption\n\nSection 36.401(d) implements the \"elevator exemption'' for new construction in section 303(b) of the ADA. The elevator exemption is an exception to the general requirement that new facilities be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. Generally, an elevator is the most common way to provide individuals who use wheelchairs \"ready access'' to floor levels above or below the ground floor of a multi-story building. Congress, however, chose not to require elevators in new small buildings, that is, those with less than three stories or less than 3,000 square feet per story. In buildings eligible for the exemption, therefore, \"ready access'' from the building entrance to a floor above or below the ground floor is not required, because the statute does not require that an elevator be installed in such buildings. The elevator exemption does not apply, however, to a facility housing a shopping center, a shopping mall, or the professional office of a health care provider, or other categories of facilities as determined by the Attorney General. For example, a new office building that will have only two stories, with no elevator planned, will not be required to have an elevator, even if each story has 20,000 square feet. In other words, having either less than 3000 square feet per story or less than three stories qualifies a facility for the exemption; it need not qualify for the exemption on both counts. Similarly, a facility that has five stories of 2800 square feet each qualifies for the exemption. If a facility has three or more stories at any point, it is not eligible for the elevator exemption unless all the stories are less than 3000 square feet.\n\nThe terms \"shopping center or shopping mall'' and \"professional office of a health care provider'' are defined in this section. They are substantively identical to the definitions included in the proposed rule in Sec.36.104, \"Definitions.'' They have been moved to this section because, as commenters pointed out, they are relevant only for the purposes of the elevator exemption, and inclusion in the general definitions section could give the incorrect impression that an office of a health care provider is not covered as a place of public accommodation under other sections of the rule, unless the office falls within the definition.\n\nFor purposes of Sec.36.401, a \"shopping center or shopping mall'' is (1) a building housing five or more sales or rental establishments, or (2) a series of buildings on a common site, either under common ownership or common control or developed either as one project or as a series of related projects, housing five or more sales or rental establishments. The term \"shopping center or shopping mall'' only includes floor levels containing at least one sales or rental establishment, or any floor level that was designed or intended for use by at least one sales or rental establishment.\n\nAny sales or rental establishment of the type that is included in paragraph (5) of the definition of \"place of public accommodation'' (for example, a bakery, grocery store, clothing store, or hardware store) is considered a sales or rental establishment for purposes of this definition; the other types of public accommodations (e.g., restaurants, laundromats, banks, travel services, health spas) are not.\n\nIn the preamble to the proposed rule, the Department sought comment on whether the definition of \"shopping center or mall'' should be expanded to include any of these other types of public accommodations. The Department also sought comment on whether a series of buildings should fall within the definition only if they are physically connected.\n\nMost of those responding to the first question (overwhelmingly groups representing people with disabilities, or individual commenters) urged that the definition encompass more places of public accommodation, such as restaurants, motion picture houses, laundromats, dry cleaners, and banks. They pointed out that often it is not known what types of establishments will be tenants in a new facility. In addition, they noted that malls are advertised as entities, that their appeal is in the \"package'' of services offered to the public, and that this package often includes the additional types of establishments mentioned.",

    "content": "In addition, they noted that malls are advertised as entities, that their appeal is in the \"package'' of services offered to the public, and that this package often includes the additional types of establishments mentioned.\n\nCommenters representing business groups sought to exempt banks, travel services, grocery stores, drug stores, and freestanding retail stores from the elevator requirement. They based this request on the desire to continue the practice in some locations of incorporating mezzanines housing administrative offices, raised pharmacist areas, and raised areas in the front of supermarkets that house safes and are used by managers to oversee operations of check-out aisles and other functions. Many of these concerns are adequately addressed by ADAAG. Apart from those addressed by ADAAG, the Department sees no reason to treat a particular type of sales or rental establishment differently from any other. Although banks and travel services are not included as \"sales or rental establishments,'' because they do not fall under paragraph (5) of the definition of place of public accommodation, grocery stores and drug stores are included.\n\nThe Department has declined to include places of public accommodation other than sales or rental establishments in the definition. The statutory definition of \"public accommodation'' (section 301(7)) lists 12 types of establishments that are considered public accommodations. Category (E) includes \"a bakery, grocery store, clothing store, hardware store, shopping center, or other sales or rental establishment.'' This arrangement suggests that it is only these types of establishments that would make up a shopping center for purposes of the statute. To include all types of places of public accommodation, or those from 6 or 7 of the categories, as commenters suggest, would overly limit the elevator exemption; the universe of facilities covered by the definition of \"shopping center'' could well exceed the number of multitenant facilities not covered, which would render the exemption almost meaningless.\n\nFor similar reasons, the Department is retaining the requirement that a building or series of buildings must house five or more sales or rental establishments before it falls within the definition of \"shopping center.'' Numerous commenters objected to the number and requested that the number be lowered from five to three or four. Lowering the number in this manner would include an inordinately large number of two-story multitenant buildings within the category of those required to have elevators.\n\nThe responses to the question concerning whether a series of buildings should be connected in order to be covered were varied. Generally, disability rights groups and some government agencies said a series of buildings should not have to be connected, and pointed to a trend in some areas to build shopping centers in a garden or village setting. The Department agrees that this design choice should not negate the elevator requirement for new construction. Some business groups answered the question in the affirmative, and some suggested a different definition of shopping center. For example, one commenter recommended the addition of a requirement that the five or more establishments be physically connected on the non-ground floors by a common pedestrian walkway or pathway, because otherwise a series of stand-alone facilities would have to comply with the elevator requirement, which would be unduly burdensome and perhaps infeasible. Another suggested use of what it characterized as the standard industry definition: \"A group of retail stores and related business facilities, the whole planned, developed, operated and managed as a unit.'' While the rule's definition would reach a series of related projects that are under common control but were not developed as a single project, the Department considers such a facility to be a shopping center within the meaning of the statute. However, in light of the hardship that could confront a series of existing small stand-alone buildings if elevators were required in alterations, the Department has included a common access route in the definition of shopping center or shopping mall for purposes of Sec.36.\n\n404. Some commenters suggested that access to restrooms and other shared facilities open to the public should be required even if those facilities were not on a shopping floor. Such a provision with respect to toilet or bathing facilities is included in the elevator exception in final ADAAG 4.1.3(5).\n\nFor purposes of this subpart, the rule does not distinguish between a \"shopping mall'' (usually a building with a roofed-over common pedestrian area serving more than one tenant in which a majority of the tenants have a main entrance from the common pedestrian area) and a \"shopping center'' (e.g., a \"shopping strip''). Any facility housing five or more of the types of sales or rental establishments described, regardless of the number of other types of places of public accommodation housed there (e.g., offices, movie theatres, restaurants), is a shopping center or shopping mall.\n\nFor example, a two-story facility built for mixed-use occupancy on both floors (e.g., by sales and rental establishments, a movie theater, restaurants, and general office space) is a shopping center or shopping mall if it houses five or more sales or rental establishments. If none of these establishments is located on the second floor, then only the ground floor, which contains the sales or rental establishments, would be a \"shopping center or shopping mall,'' unless the second floor was designed or intended for use by at least one sales or rental establishment. In determining whether a floor was intended for such use, factors to be considered include the types of establishments that first occupied the floor, the nature of the developer's marketing strategy, i.e., what types of establishments were sought, and inclusion of any design features particular to rental and sales establishments.\n\nA \"professional office of a health care provider'' is defined as a location where a person or entity regulated by a State to provide professional services related to the physical or mental health of an individual makes such services available to the public. In a two-story development that houses health care providers only on the ground floor, the \"professional office of a health care provider'' is limited to the ground floor unless the second floor was designed or intended for use by a health care provider. In determining if a floor was intended for such use, factors to be considered include whether the facility was constructed with special plumbing, electrical, or other features needed by health care providers, whether the developer marketed the facility as a medical office center, and whether any of the establishments that first occupied the floor was, in fact, a health care provider.",

The Department, as it proposed to do, has added to the nonexempt categories terminals, depots, or other stations used for specified public transportation, and airport passenger terminals. Numerous commenters in all categories endorsed this proposal; none opposed it. It is not uncommon for an airport passenger terminal or train station, for example, to have only two floors, with gates on both floors. Because of the significance of transportation, because a person with disabilities could be arriving or departing at any gate, and because inaccessible facilities could result in a total denial of transportation services, it is reasonable to require that newly constructed transit facilities be accessible, regardless of square footage or number of floors. One comment suggested an amendment that would treat terminals and stations similarly to shopping centers, by requiring an accessible route only to those areas used for passenger loading and unloading and for other passenger services. Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) has been modified accordingly.\n\nSome commenters suggested that other types of facilities (e.g., educational facilities, libraries, museums, commercial facilities, and social service facilities) should be included in the category of nonexempt facilities. The Department has not found adequate justification for including any other types of facilities in the nonexempt category at this time.\n\nSection 36.401(d)(2) establishes the operative requirements concerning the elevator exemption and its application to shopping centers and malls, professional offices of health care providers, transit stations, and airport passenger terminals. Under the rule's framework, it is necessary first to determine if a new facility (including one or more buildings) houses places of public accommodation or commercial facilities that are in the categories for which elevators are required. If so, and the facility is a shopping center or shopping mall, or a professional office of a health care provider, then any area housing such an office or a sales or rental establishment or the professional office of a health care provider is not entitled to the elevator exemption.\n\nThe following examples illustrate the application of these principles:\n\n1. A shopping mall has an upper and a lower level. There are two \"anchor stores'' (in this case, major department stores at either end of the mall, both with exterior entrances and an entrance on each level from the common area). In addition, there are 30 stores (sales or rental establishments) on the upper level, all of which have entrances from a common central area. There are 30 stores on the lower level, all of which have entrances from a common central area. According to the rule, elevator access must be provided to each store and to each level of the anchor stores. This requirement could be satisfied with respect to the 60 stores through elevators connecting the two pedestrian levels, provided that an individual could travel from the elevator to any other point on that level (i.e., into any store through a common pedestrian area) on an accessible path.\n\n2. A commercial (nonresidential) \"townhouse'' development is composed of 20 two-story attached buildings. The facility is developed as one project, with common ownership, and the space will be leased to retailers. Each building has one accessible entrance from a pedestrian walk to the first floor. From that point, one can enter a store on the first floor, or walk up a flight of stairs to a store on the second floor. All 40 stores must be accessible at ground floor level or by accessible vertical access from that level. This does not mean, however, that 20 elevators must be installed. Access could be provided to the second floor by an elevator from the pedestrian area on the lower level to an upper walkway connecting all the areas on the second floor.\n\n3. In the same type of development, it is planned that retail stores will be housed exclusively on the ground floor, with only office space (not professional offices of health care providers) on the second. Elevator access need not be provided to the second floor because all the sales or rental establishments (the entities that make the facility a shopping center) are located on an accessible ground floor.\n\n4. In the same type of development, the space is designed and marketed as medical or office suites, or as a medical office facility. Accessible vertical access must be provided to all areas, as described in example 2.\n\nSome commenters suggested that building owners who knowingly lease or rent space to nonexempt places of public accommodation would violate Sec.36.\n\n401. However, the Department does not consider leasing or renting inaccessible space in itself to constitute a violation of this part. Nor does a change in use of a facility, with no accompanying alterations (e.g., if a psychiatrist replaces an attorney as a tenant in a second-floor office, but no alterations are made to the office) trigger accessibility requirements.\n\nEntities cannot evade the requirements of this section by constructing facilities in such a way that no story is intended to constitute a \"ground floor.'' For example, if a private entity constructs a building whose main entrance leads only to stairways or escalators that connect with upper or lower floors, the Department would consider at least one level of the facility a ground story.\n\nThe rule requires in Sec.36.401(d)(3), consistent with the proposed rule, that, even if a building falls within the elevator exemption, the floor or floors other than the ground floor must nonetheless be accessible, except for elevator access, to individuals with disabilities, including people who use wheelchairs. This requirement applies to buildings that do not house sales or rental establishments or the professional offices of a health care provider as well as to those in which such establishments or offices are all located on the ground floor. In such a situation, little added cost is entailed in making the second floor accessible, because it is similar in structure and floor plan to the ground floor.",

    "content": "In such a situation, little added cost is entailed in making the second floor accessible, because it is similar in structure and floor plan to the ground floor.\n\nThere are several reasons for this provision. First, some individuals who are mobility impaired may work on a building's second floor, which they can reach by stairs and the use of crutches; however, the same individuals, once they reach the second floor, may then use a wheelchair that is kept in the office. Secondly, because the first floor will be accessible, there will be little additional cost entailed in making the second floor, with the same structure and generally the same floor plan, accessible. In addition, the second floor must be accessible to those persons with disabilities who do not need elevators for level changes (for example, persons with sight or hearing impairments and those with certain mobility impairments). Finally, if an elevator is installed in the future for any reason, full access to the floor will be facilitated.\n\nOne commenter asserted that this provision goes beyond the Department's authority under the Act, and disagreed with the Department's claim that little additional cost would be entailed in compliance. However, the provision is taken directly from the legislative history (see Education and Labor report at 114).\n\nOne commenter said that where an elevator is not required, platform lifts should be required. Two commenters pointed out that the elevator exemption is really an exemption from the requirement for providing an accessible route to a second floor not served by an elevator. The Department agrees with the latter comment. Lifts to provide access between floors are not required in buildings that are not required to have elevators. This point is specifically addressed in the appendix to ADAAG (Sec.4.1.3(5)). ADAAG also addresses in detail the situations in which lifts are permitted or required.\n\nSection 36.402 Alterations\n\nSections 36.402 - 36.405 implement section 303(a)(2) of the Act, which requires that alterations to existing facilities be made in a way that ensures that the altered portion is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. This part does not require alterations; it simply provides that when alterations are undertaken, they must be made in a manner that provides access.\n\nSection 36.402(a)(1) provides that any alteration to a place of public accommodation or a commercial facility, after 1992-01-26, shall be made so as to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the altered portions of the facility are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs.\n\nThe proposed rule provided that an alteration would be deemed to be undertaken after 1992-01-26, if the physical alteration of the property is in progress after that date. Commenters pointed out that this provision would, in some cases, produce an unjust result by requiring the redesign or retrofitting of projects initiated before this part established the ADA accessibility standards. The Department agrees that the proposed rule would, in some instances, unfairly penalize projects that were substantially completed before the effective date. Therefore, paragraph (a)(2) has been revised to specify that an alteration will be deemed to be undertaken after 1992-01-26, if the physical alteration of the property begins after that date. As a matter of interpretation, the Department will construe this provision to apply to alterations that require a permit from a State, County or local government, if physical alterations pursuant to the terms of the permit begin after 1992-01-26. The Department recognizes that this application of the effective date may require redesign of some facilities that were planned prior to the publication of this part, but no retrofitting will be required of facilities on which the physical alterations were initiated prior to the effective date of the Act. Of course, nothing in this section in any way alters the obligation of any facility to remove architectural barriers in existing facilities to the extent that such barrier removal is readily achievable.\n\nParagraph (b) provides that, for the purposes of this part, an \"alteration'' is a change to a place of public accommodation or a commercial facility that affects or could affect the usability of the building or facility or any part thereof. One commenter suggested that the concept of usability should apply only to those changes that affect access by persons with disabilities. The Department remains convinced that the Act requires the concept of \"usability'' to be read broadly to include any change that affects the usability of the facility, not simply changes that relate directly to access by individuals with disabilities.\n\nThe Department received a significant number of comments on the examples provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the proposed rule. Some commenters urged the Department to limit the application of this provision to major structural modifications, while others asserted that it should be expanded to include cosmetic changes such as painting and wallpapering. The Department believes that neither approach is consistent with the legislative history, which requires this Department's regulation to be consistent with the accessibility guidelines (ADAAG) developed by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB). Although the legislative history contemplates that, in some instances, the ADA accessibility standards will exceed the current MGRAD requirements, it also clearly indicates the view of the drafters that \"minor changes such as painting or papering walls * * * do not affect usability'' (Education and Labor report at 111, Judiciary report at 64), and, therefore, are not alterations. The proposed rule was based on the existing MGRAD definition of \"alteration.'' The language of the final rule has been revised to be consistent with ADAAG, incorporated as appendix A to this part.\n\nSome commenters sought clarification of the intended scope of this section. The proposed rule contained illustrations of changes that affect usability and those that do not. The intent of the illustrations was to explain the scope of the alterations requirement; the effect was to obscure it. As a result of the illustrations, some commenters concluded that any alteration to a facility, even a minor alteration such as relocating an electrical outlet, would trigger an extensive obligation to provide access throughout an entire facility. That result was never contemplated.\n\nTherefore, in this final rule paragraph (b)(1) has been revised to include the major provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the proposed rule. The examples in the proposed rule have been deleted. Paragraph (b)(1) now provides that alterations include, but are not limited to, remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, historic restoration, changes or rearrangement in structural parts or elements, and changes or rearrangement in the plan configuration of walls and full-height partitions. Normal maintenance, reroofing, painting or wallpapering, asbestos removal, or changes to mechanical and electrical systems are not alterations unless they affect the usability of building or facility.\n\nParagraph (b)(2) of this final rule was added to clarify the scope of the alterations requirement. Paragraph (b)(2) provides that if existing elements, spaces, or common areas are altered, then each such altered element, space, or area shall comply with the applicable provisions of appendix A (ADAAG). As provided in Sec.36.403, if an altered space or area is an area of the facility that contains a primary function, then the requirements of that section apply.",

    "content": "As provided in Sec.36.403, if an altered space or area is an area of the facility that contains a primary function, then the requirements of that section apply.\n\nTherefore, when an entity undertakes a minor alteration to a place of public accommodation or commercial facility, such as moving an electrical outlet, the new outlet must be installed in compliance with ADAAG. (Alteration of the elements listed in Sec.36.403(c)(2) cannot trigger a path of travel obligation.) If the alteration is to an area, such as an employee lounge or locker room, that is not an area of the facility that contains a primary function, that area must comply with ADAAG. It is only when an alteration affects access to or usability of an area containing a primary function, as opposed to other areas or the elements listed in Sec.36.403(c)(2), that the path of travel to the altered area must be made accessible.\n\nThe Department received relatively few comments on paragraph (c), which explains the statutory phrase \"to the maximum extent feasible.'' Some commenters suggested that the regulation should specify that cost is a factor in determining whether it is feasible to make an altered area accessible. The legislative history of the ADA indicates that the concept of feasibility only reaches the question of whether it is possible to make the alteration accessible in compliance with this part. Costs are to be considered only when an alteration to an area containing a primary function triggers an additional requirement to make the path of travel to the altered area accessible.\n\nSection 36.402(c) is, therefore, essentially unchanged from the proposed rule. At the recommendation of a commenter, the Department has inserted the word \"virtually'' to modify \"impossible'' to conform to the language of the legislative history. It explains that the phrase \"to the maximum extent feasible'' as used in this section applies to the occasional case where the nature of an existing facility makes it virtually impossible to comply fully with applicable accessibility standards through a planned alteration. In the occasional cases in which full compliance is impossible, alterations shall provide the maximum physical accessibility feasible. Any features of the facility that are being altered shall be made accessible unless it is technically infeasible to do so. If providing accessibility in conformance with this section to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs) would not be feasible, the facility shall be made accessible to persons with other types of disabilities (e.g., those who use crutches or who have impaired vision or hearing, or those who have other types of impairments).\n\nSection 36.403 Alterations: Path of Travel\n\nSection 36.403 implements the statutory requirement that any alteration that affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area of a facility that contains a primary function shall be made so as to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered area, and the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area, are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, unless the cost and scope of such alterations is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration. Paragraph (a) restates this statutory requirement.\n\nParagraph (b) defines a \"primary function'' as a major activity for which the facility is intended. This paragraph is unchanged from the proposed rule. Areas that contain a primary function include, but are not limited to, the customer services lobby of a bank, the dining area of a cafeteria, the meeting rooms in a conference center, as well as offices and all other work areas in which the activities of the public accommodation or other private entities using the facility are carried out. The concept of \"areas containing a primary function'' is analogous to the concept of \"functional spaces'' in Sec.3.5 of the existing Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards, which defines \"functional spaces'' as \"[t]he rooms and spaces in a building or facility that house the major activities for which the building or facility is intended.''\n\nParagraph (b) provides that areas such as mechanical rooms, boiler rooms, supply storage rooms, employee lounges and locker rooms, janitorial closets, entrances, corridors, and restrooms are not areas containing a primary function. There may be exceptions to this general rule. For example, the availability of public restrooms at a place of public accommodation at a roadside rest stop may be a major factor affecting customers' decisions to patronize the public accommodation. In that case, a restroom would be considered to be an \"area containing a primary function'' of the facility.\n\nMost of the commenters who addressed this issue supported the approach taken by the Department; but a few commenters suggested that areas not open to the general public or those used exclusively by employees should be excluded from the definition of primary function. The preamble to the proposed rule noted that the Department considered an alternative approach to the definition of \"primary function,'' under which a primary function of a commercial facility would be defined as a major activity for which the facility was intended, while a primary function of a place of public accommodation would be defined as an activity which involves providing significant goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations. However, the Department concluded that, although portions of the legislative history of the ADA support this alternative, the better view is that the language now contained in Sec.36.403(b) most accurately reflects congressional intent. No commenter made a persuasive argument that the Department's interpretation of the legislative history is incorrect.\n\nWhen the ADA was introduced, the requirement to make alterations accessible was included in section 302 of the Act, which identifies the practices that constitute discrimination by a public accommodation. Because section 302 applies only to the operation of a place of public accommodation, the alterations requirement was intended only to provide access to clients and customers of a public accommodation. It was anticipated that access would be provided to employees with disabilities under the \"reasonable accommodation'' requirements of title I. However, during its consideration of the ADA, the House Judiciary Committee amended the bill to move the alterations provision from section 302 to section 303, which applies to commercial facilities as well as public accommodations. The Committee report accompanying the bill explains that:\n\nNew construction and alterations of both public accommodations and commercial facilities must be made readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities * * *. Essentially, [this requirement] is designed to ensure that patrons and employees of public accommodations and commercial facilities are able to get to, enter and use the facility * * *. The rationale for making new construction accessible applies with equal force to alterations.\n\nJudiciary report at 62 - 63 (emphasis added).\n\nThe ADA, as enacted, contains the language of section 303 as it was reported out of the Judiciary Committee. Therefore, the Department has concluded that the concept of \"primary function'' should be applied in the same manner to places of public accommodation and to commercial facilities, thereby including employee work areas in places of public accommodation within the scope of this section.",

    "content": "Therefore, the Department has concluded that the concept of \"primary function'' should be applied in the same manner to places of public accommodation and to commercial facilities, thereby including employee work areas in places of public accommodation within the scope of this section.\n\nParagraph (c) provides examples of alterations that affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function. The examples include: Remodeling a merchandise display area or employee work areas in a department store; installing a new floor surface to replace an inaccessible surface in the customer service area or employee work areas of a bank; redesigning the assembly line area of a factory; and installing a computer center in an accounting firm. This list is illustrative, not exhaustive. Any change that affects the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function triggers the statutory obligation to make the path of travel to the altered area accessible.\n\nWhen the proposed rule was drafted, the Department believed that the rule made it clear that the ADA would require alterations to the path of travel only when such alterations are not disproportionate to the alteration to the primary function area. However, the comments that the Department received indicated that many commenters believe that even minor alterations to individual elements would require additional alterations to the path of travel. To address the concern of these commenters, a new paragraph (c)(2) has been added to the final rule to provide that alterations to such elements as windows, hardware, controls (e.\n\ng. light switches or thermostats), electrical outlets, or signage will not be deemed to be alterations that affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function. Of course, each element that is altered must comply with ADAAG (appendix A) . The cost of alterations to individual elements would be included in the overall cost of an alteration for purposes of determining disproportionality and would be counted when determining the aggregate cost of a series of small alterations in accordance with Sec.36.401(h) if the area is altered in a manner that affects access to or usability of an area containing a primary function.\n\nParagraph (d) concerns the respective obligations of landlords and tenants in the cases of alterations that trigger the path of travel requirement under Sec.36.\n\n403. This paragraph was contained in the landlord/tenant section of the proposed rule, Sec.36.201(b). If a tenant is making alterations upon its premises pursuant to terms of a lease that grant it the authority to do so (even if they constitute alterations that trigger the path of travel requirement), and the landlord is not making alterations to other parts of the facility, then the alterations by the tenant on its own premises do not trigger a path of travel obligation upon the landlord in areas of the facility under the landlord's authority that are not otherwise being altered. The legislative history makes clear that the path of travel requirement applies only to the entity that is already making the alteration, and thus the Department has not changed the final rule despite numerous comments suggesting that the tenant be required to provide a path of travel.\n\nParagraph (e) defines a \"path of travel'' as a continuous, unobstructed way of pedestrian passage by means of which an altered area may be approached, entered, and exited; and which connects the altered area with an exterior approach (including sidewalks, streets, and parking areas), an entrance to the facility, and other parts of the facility. This concept of an accessible path of travel is analogous to the concepts of \"accessible route'' and \"circulation path'' contained in section 3.5 of the current UFAS. Some commenters suggested that this paragraph should address emergency egress. The Department disagrees. \"Path of travel'' as it is used in this section is a term of art under the ADA that relates only to the obligation of the public accommodation or commercial facility to provide additional accessible elements when an area containing a primary function is altered. The Department recognizes that emergency egress is an important issue, but believes that it is appropriately addressed in ADAAG (appendix A), not in this paragraph. Furthermore, ADAAG does not require changes to emergency egress areas in alterations.\n\nParagraph (e)(2) is drawn from section 3.5 of UFAS. It provides that an accessible path of travel may consist of walks and sidewalks, curb ramps and other interior or exterior pedestrian ramps; clear floor paths through lobbies, corridors, rooms, and other improved areas; parking access aisles; elevators and lifts; or a combination of such elements. Paragraph (e)(3) provides that, for the purposes of this part, the term \"path of travel'' also includes the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving an altered area.\n\nAlthough the Act establishes an expectation that an accessible path of travel should generally be included when alterations are made to an area containing a primary function, Congress recognized that, in some circumstances, providing an accessible path of travel to an altered area may be sufficiently burdensome in comparison to the alteration being undertaken to the area containing a primary function as to render this requirement unreasonable. Therefore, Congress provided, in section 303(a)(2) of the Act, that alterations to the path of travel that are disproportionate in cost and scope to the overall alteration are not required.\n\nThe Act requires the Attorney General to determine at what point the cost of providing an accessible path of travel becomes disproportionate. The proposed rule provided three options for making this determination.\n\nTwo committees of Congress specifically addressed this issue: the House Committee on Education and Labor and the House Committee on the Judiciary. The reports issued by each committee suggested that accessibility alterations to a path of travel might be \"disproportionate'' if they exceed 30% of the alteration costs (Education and Labor report at 113; Judiciary report at 64). Because the Department believed that smaller percentage rates might be appropriate, the proposed rule sought comments on three options: 10%, 20%, or 30%.\n\nThe Department received a significant number of comments on this section. Commenters representing individuals with disabilities generally supported the use of 30% (or more); commenters representing covered entities supported a figure of 10% (or less). The Department believes that alterations made to provide an accessible path of travel to the altered area should be deemed disproportionate to the overall alteration when the cost exceeds 20% of the cost of the alteration to the primary function area. This approach appropriately reflects the intent of Congress to provide access for individuals with disabilities without causing economic hardship for the covered public accommodations and commercial facilities.\n\nThe Department has determined that the basis for this cost calculation shall be the cost of the alterations to the area containing the primary function. This approach will enable the public accommodation or other private entity that is making the alteration to calculate its obligation as a percentage of a clearly ascertainable base cost, rather than as a percentage of the \"total'' cost, an amount that will change as accessibility alterations to the path of travel are made.",

It provides examples of costs that may be counted as expenditures required to provide an accessible path of travel. They include:\n\n- Costs associated with providing an accessible entrance and an accessible route to the altered area, for example, the cost of widening doorways or installing ramps;\n\n- Costs associated with making restrooms accessible, such as installing grab bars, enlarging toilet stalls, insulating pipes, or installing accessible faucet controls;\n\n- Costs associated with providing accessible telephones, such as relocating telephones to an accessible height, installing amplification devices, or installing telecommunications devices for deaf persons (TDD's);\n\n- Costs associated with relocating an inaccessible drinking fountain.\n\nParagraph (f)(1) of the proposed rule provided that when the cost of alterations necessary to make the path of travel serving an altered area fully accessible is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration, the path of travel shall be made accessible to the maximum extent feasible. In response to the suggestion of a commenter, the Department has made an editorial change in the final rule (paragraph (g)(1)) to clarify that if the cost of providing a fully accessible path of travel is disproportionate, the path of travel shall be made accessible \"to the extent that it can be made accessible without incurring disproportionate costs.''\n\nParagraph (g)(2) (paragraph (f)(2) in the NPRM) establishes that priority should be given to those elements that will provide the greatest access, in the following order: An accessible entrance; an accessible route to the altered area; at least one accessible restroom for each sex or a single unisex restroom; accessible telephones; accessible drinking fountains; and, whenever possible, additional accessible elements such as parking, storage, and alarms. This paragraph is unchanged from the proposed rule.\n\nParagraph (h) (paragraph (g) in the proposed rule) provides that the obligation to provide an accessible path of travel may not be evaded by performing a series of small alterations to the area served by a single path of travel if those alterations could have been performed as a single undertaking. If an area containing a primary function has been altered without providing an accessible path of travel to serve that area, and subsequent alterations of that area, or a different area on the same path of travel, are undertaken within three years of the original alteration, the total cost of alterations to primary function areas on that path of travel during the preceding three year period shall be considered in determining whether the cost of making the path of travel serving that area accessible is disproportionate. Only alterations undertaken after 1992-01-26, shall be considered in determining if the cost of providing accessible features is disproportionate to the overall cost of the alterations.\n\nSection 36.404 Alterations: Elevator Exemption\n\nSection 36.404 implements the elevator exemption in section 303(b) of the Act as it applies to altered facilities. The provisions of section 303(b) are discussed in the preamble to Sec.36.401(d) above. The statute applies the same exemption to both new construction and alterations. The principal difference between the requirements of Sec.36.401(d) and Sec.36.404 is that, in altering an existing facility that is not eligible for the statutory exemption, the public accommodation or other private entity responsible for the alteration is not required to install an elevator if the installation of an elevator would be disproportionate in cost and scope to the cost of the overall alteration as provided in Sec.36.403(f)(1). In addition, the standards referenced in Sec.36.406 (ADAAG) provide that installation of an elevator in an altered facility is not required if it is \"technically infeasible.''\n\nThis section has been revised to define the terms \"professional office of a health care provider'' and \"shopping center or shopping mall'' for the purposes of this section. The definition of \"professional office of a health care provider'' is identical to the definition included in Sec.36.401(d).\n\nIt has been brought to the attention of the Department that there is some misunderstanding about the scope of the elevator exemption as it applies to the professional office of a health care provider. A public accommodation, such as the professional office of a health care provider, is required to remove architectural barriers to its facility to the extent that such barrier removal is readily achievable (see Sec.36.304), but it is not otherwise required by this part to undertake new construction or alterations. This part does not require that an existing two story building that houses the professional office of a health care provider be altered for the purpose of providing elevator access. If, however, alterations to the area housing the office of the health care provider are undertaken for other purposes, the installation of an elevator might be required, but only if the cost of the elevator is not disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration. Neither the Act nor this part prohibits a health care provider from locating his or her professional office in an existing facility that does not have an elevator.\n\nBecause of the unique challenges presented in altering existing facilities, the Department has adopted a definition of \"shopping center or shopping mall'' for the purposes of this section that is slightly different from the definition adopted under Sec.36.401(d). For the purposes of this section, a \"shopping center or shopping mall'' is (1) a building housing five or more sales or rental establishments, or (2) a series of buildings on a common site, connected by a common pedestrian access route above or below the ground floor, either under common ownership or common control or developed either as one project or as a series of related projects, housing five or more sales or rental establishments. As is the case with new construction, the term \"shopping center or shopping mall'' only includes floor levels housing at least one sales or rental establishment, or any floor level that was designed or intended for use by at least one sales or rental establishment.\n\nThe Department believes that it is appropriate to use a different definition of \"shopping center or shopping mall'' for this section than for Sec.36.401, in order to make it clear that a series of existing buildings on a common site that is altered for the use of sales or rental establishments does not become a \"shopping center or shopping mall'' required to install an elevator, unless there is a common means of pedestrian access above or below the ground floor. Without this exemption, separate, but adjacent, buildings that were initially designed and constructed independently of each other could be required to be retrofitted with elevators, if they were later renovated for a purpose not contemplated at the time of construction.",

    "content": "Without this exemption, separate, but adjacent, buildings that were initially designed and constructed independently of each other could be required to be retrofitted with elevators, if they were later renovated for a purpose not contemplated at the time of construction.\n\nLike Sec.36.401(d), Sec.36.404 provides that the exemptions in this paragraph do not obviate or limit in any way the obligation to comply with the other accessibility requirements established in this subpart. For example, alterations to floors above or below the ground floor must be accessible regardless of whether the altered facility has an elevator. If a facility that is not required to install an elevator nonetheless has an elevator, that elevator shall meet, to the maximum extent feasible, the accessibility requirements of this section.\n\nSection 36.405 Alterations: Historic Preservation\n\nSection 36.405 gives effect to the intent of Congress, expressed in section 504(c) of the Act, that this part recognize the national interest in preserving significant historic structures. Commenters criticized the Department's use of descriptive terms in the proposed rule that are different from those used in the ADA to describe eligible historic properties. In addition, some commenters criticized the Department's decision to use the concept of \"substantially impairing'' the historic features of a property, which is a concept employed in regulations implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Those commenters recommended that the Department adopt the criteria of \"adverse effect'' published by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation under the National Historic Preservation Act (36 CFR 800.9) as the standard for determining whether an historic property may be altered.\n\nThe Department agrees with these comments to the extent that they suggest that the language of the rule should conform to the language employed by Congress in the ADA. Therefore, the language of this section has been revised to make it clear that this provision applies to buildings or facilities that are eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places under the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.) and to buildings or facilities that are designated as historic under State or local law. The Department believes, however, that the criteria of adverse effect employed under the National Historic Preservation Act are inappropriate for this rule because section 504(c) of the ADA specifies that special alterations provisions shall apply only when an alteration would \"threaten or destroy the historic significance of qualified historic buildings and facilities.''\n\nThe Department intends that the exception created by this section be applied only in those very rare situations in which it is not possible to provide access to an historic property using the special access provisions in ADAAG. Therefore, paragraph (a) of Sec.36.405 has been revised to provide that alterations to historic properties shall comply, to the maximum extent feasible, with section 4.1.7 of ADAAG. Paragraph (b) of this section has been revised to provide that if it has been determined, under the procedures established in ADAAG, that it is not feasible to provide physical access to an historic property that is a place of public accommodation in a manner that will not threaten or destroy the historic significance of the property, alternative methods of access shall be provided pursuant to the requirements of Subpart C.\n\nSection 36.406 Standards for New Construction and Alterations\n\nSection 36.406 implements the requirements of sections 306(b) and 306(c) of the Act, which require the Attorney General to promulgate standards for accessible design for buildings and facilities subject to the Act and this part that are consistent with the supplemental minimum guidelines and requirements for accessible design published by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB or Board) pursuant to section 504 of the Act. This section of the rule provides that new construction and alterations subject to this part shall comply with the standards for accessible design published as appendix A to this part.\n\nAppendix A contains the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG) which is being published by the ATBCB as a final rule elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register. As proposed in this Department's proposed rule, Sec.36.406(a) adopts ADAAG as the accessibility standard applicable under this rule.\n\nParagraph (b) was not included in the proposed rule. It provides, in chart form, guidance for using ADAAG together with subparts A through D of this part when determining requirements for a particular facility. This chart is intended solely as guidance for the user; it has no effect for purposes of compliance or enforcement. It does not necessarily provide complete or mandatory information.\n\nProposed Sec.36.406(b) is not included in the final rule. That provision, which would have taken effect only if the final rule had followed the proposed Option Two for Sec.36.401(a), is unnecessary because the Department has chosen Option One, as explained in the preamble for that section.\n\nSection 504(a) of the ADA requires the ATBCB to issue minimum guidelines to supplement the existing Minimum Guidelines and Requirements for Accessible Design (MGRAD) (36 CFR part 1190) for purposes of title III. According to section 504(b) of the Act, the guidelines are to establish additional requirements, consistent with the Act, \"to ensure that buildings and facilities are accessible, in terms of architecture and design, ...and communication, to individuals with disabilities.'' Section 306(c) of the Act requires that the accessibility standards included in the Department's regulations be consistent with the minimum guidelines, in this case ADAAG.\n\nAs explained in the ATBCB's preamble to ADAAG, the substance and form of the guidelines are drawn from several sources. They use as their model the 1984 Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) (41 CFR part 101, subpart 101 -19.6, appendix), which are the standards implementing the Architectural Barriers Act. UFAS is based on the Board's 1982 MGRAD. ADAAG follows the numbering system and format of the private sector American National Standard Institute's ANSI A117.1 standards. (American National Specifications for Making Buildings and Facilities Accessible to and Usable by Physically Handicapped People (ANSI A117 - 1980) and American National Standard for Buildings and Facilities -- Providing Accessibility and Usability for Physically Handicapped People (ANSI A117.1 - 1986).) ADAAG supplements MGRAD. In developing ADAAG, the Board made every effort to be consistent with MGRAD and the current and proposed ANSI Standards, to the extent consistent with the ADA.",

    "content": "In developing ADAAG, the Board made every effort to be consistent with MGRAD and the current and proposed ANSI Standards, to the extent consistent with the ADA.\n\nADAAG consists of nine main sections and a separate appendix. Sections 1 through 3 contain general provisions and definitions. Section 4 contains scoping provisions and technical specifications applicable to all covered buildings and facilities. The scoping provisions are listed separately for new construction of sites and exterior facilities; new construction of buildings; additions; alterations; and alterations to historic properties. The technical specifications generally reprint the text and illustrations of the ANSI A117.1 standard, except where differences are noted by italics. Sections 5 through 9 of the guidelines are special application sections and contain additional requirements for restaurants and cafeterias, medical care facilities, business and mercantile facilities, libraries, and transient lodging. The appendix to the guidelines contains additional information to aid in understanding the technical specifications. The section numbers in the appendix correspond to the sections of the guidelines to which they relate. An asterisk after a section number indicates that additional information appears in the appendix.\n\nADAAG's provisions are further explained under Summary of ADAAG below.\n\nGeneral Comments\n\nOne commenter urged the Department to move all or portions of subpart D, New Construction and Alterations, to the appendix (ADAAG) or to duplicate portions of subpart D in the appendix. The commenter correctly pointed out that subpart D is inherently linked to ADAAG, and that a self-contained set of rules would be helpful to users. The Department has attempted to simplify use of the two documents by deleting some paragraphs from subpart D (e.g., those relating to work areas), because they are included in ADAAG. However, the Department has retained in subpart D those sections that are taken directly from the statute or that give meaning to specific statutory concepts (e.g., structural impracticability, path of travel). While some of the subpart D provisions are duplicated in ADAAG, others are not. For example, issues relating to path of travel and disproportionality in alterations are not addressed in detail in ADAAG. (The structure and contents of the two documents are addressed below under Summary of ADAAG.) While the Department agrees that it would be useful to have one self-contained document, the different focuses of this rule and ADAAG do not permit this result at this time. However, the chart included in Sec.36.406(b) should assist users in applying the provisions of subparts A through D, and ADAAG together.\n\nNumerous business groups have urged the Department not to adopt the proposed ADAAG as the accessibility standards, because the requirements established are too high, reflect the \"state of the art,'' and are inflexible, rigid, and impractical. Many of these objections have been lodged on the basis that ADAAG exceeds the statutory mandate to establish \"minimum'' guidelines. In the view of the Department, these commenters have misconstrued the meaning of the term \"minimum guidelines.'' The statute clearly contemplates that the guidelines establish a level of access -- a minimum -- that the standards must meet or exceed. The guidelines are not to be \"minimal'' in the sense that they would provide for a low level of access. To the contrary, Congress emphasized that the ADA requires a \"high degree of convenient access.'' Education and Labor report at 117 - 18. The legislative history explains that the guidelines may not \"reduce, weaken, narrow or set less accessibility standards than those included in existing MGRAD'' and should provide greater guidance in communication accessibility for individuals with hearing and vision impairments. Id. at 139. Nor did Congress contemplate a set of guidelines less detailed than ADAAG; the statute requires that the ADA guidelines supplement the existing MGRAD. When it established the statutory scheme, Congress was aware of the content and purpose of the 1982 MGRAD; as ADAAG does with respect to ADA, MGRAD establishes a minimum level of access that the Architectural Barriers Act standards (i.e., UFAS) must meet or exceed, and includes a high level of detail.\n\nMany of the same commenters urged the Department to incorporate as its accessibility standards the ANSI standard's technical provisions and to adopt the proposed scoping provisions under development by the Council of American Building Officials' Board for the Coordination of Model Codes (BCMC). They contended that the ANSI standard is familiar to and accepted by professionals, and that both documents are developed through consensus. They suggested that ADAAG will not stay current, because it does not follow an established cyclical review process, and that it is not likely to be adopted by nonfederal jurisdictions in State and local codes. They urged the Department and the Board to coordinate the ADAAG provisions and any substantive changes to them with the ANSI A117 committee in order to maintain a consistent and uniform set of accessibility standards that can be efficiently and effectively implemented at the State and local level through the existing building regulatory processes.\n\nThe Department shares the commenters' goal of coordination between the private sector and Federal standards, to the extent that coordination can lead to substantive requirements consistent with the ADA. A single accessibility standard, or consistent accessibility standards, that can be used for ADA purposes and that can be incorporated or referenced by State and local governments, would help to ensure that the ADA requirements are routinely implemented at the design stage. The Department plans to work toward this goal.\n\nThe Department, however, must comply with the requirements of the ADA, the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C app. 1 et seq.) and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C 551 et seq.). Neither the Department nor the Board can adopt private requirements wholesale. Furthermore, neither the 1991 ANSI A117 Standard revision nor the BCMC process is complete. Although the ANSI and BCMC provisions are not final, the Board has carefully considered both the draft BCMC scoping provisions and draft ANSI technical standards and included their language in ADAAG wherever consistent with the ADA.\n\nSome commenters requested that, if the Department did not adopt ANSI by reference, the Department declare compliance with ANSI/BCMC to constitute equivalency with the ADA standards. The Department has not adopted this recommendation but has instead worked as a member of the ATBCB to ensure that its accessibility standards are practical and usable. In addition, as explained under subpart F, Certification of State Laws or Local Building Codes, the proper forum for further evaluation of this suggested approach would be in conjunction with the certification process.",

Such an additional comment period is unnecessary and would unduly delay the issuance of final regulations. The Department put the public on notice, through the proposed rule, of its intention to adopt the proposed ADAAG, with any changes made by the Board, as the accessibility standards. As a member of the Board and of its ADA Task Force, the Department participated actively in the public hearings held on the proposed guidelines and in preparation of both the proposed and final versions of ADAAG. Many individuals and groups commented directly to the Department's docket, or at its public hearings, about ADAAG. The comments received on ADAAG, whether by the Board or by this Department, were thoroughly analyzed and considered by the Department in the context of whether the proposed ADAAG was consistent with the ADA and suitable for adoption as both guidelines and standards. The Department is convinced that ADAAG as adopted in its final form is appropriate for these purposes. The final guidelines, adopted here as standards, will ensure the high level of access contemplated by Congress, consistent with the ADA's balance between the interests of people with disabilities and the business community.\n\nA few commenters, citing the Senate report (at 70) and the Education and Labor report (at 119), asked the Department to include in the regulations a provision stating that departures from particular technical and scoping requirements of the accessibility standards will be permitted so long as the alternative methods used will provide substantially equivalent or greater access to and utilization of the facility. Such a provision is found in ADAAG 2.2 and by virtue of that fact is included in these regulations.\n\nComments on specific provisions of proposed ADAAG\n\nDuring the course of accepting comments on its proposed rule, the Department received numerous comments on ADAAG. Those areas that elicited the heaviest response included assistive listening systems, automated teller machines, work areas, parking, areas of refuge, telephones (scoping for TDD's and volume controls) and visual alarms. Strenuous objections were raised by some business commenters to the proposed provisions of the guidelines concerning check-out aisles, counters, and scoping for hotels and nursing facilities. All these comments were considered in the same manner as other comments on the Department's proposed rule and, in the Department's view, have been addressed adequately in the final ADAAG.\n\nLargely in response to comments, the Board made numerous changes from its proposal, including the following:\n\n- Generally, at least 50% of public entrances to new buildings must be accessible, rather than all entrances, as would often have resulted from the proposed approach.\n\n- Not all check-out aisles are required to be accessible.\n\n- The final guidelines provide greater flexibility in providing access to sales counters, and no longer require a portion of every counter to be accessible.\n\n- Scoping for TDD's or text telephones was increased. One TDD or text telephone, for speech and hearing impaired persons, must be provided at locations with 4, rather than 6, pay phones, and in hospitals and shopping malls. Use of portable (less expensive) TDD's is allowed.\n\n- Dispersal of wheelchair seating areas in theaters will be required only where there are more than 300 seats, rather than in all cases. Seats with removable armrests (i.e., seats into which persons with mobility impairments can transfer) will also be required.\n\n- Areas of refuge (areas with direct access to a stairway, and where people who cannot use stairs may await assistance during a emergency evacuation) will be required, as proposed, but the final provisions are based on the Uniform Building Code. Such areas are not required in alterations.\n\n- Rather than requiring 5% of new hotel rooms to be accessible to people with mobility impairments, between 2 and 4% accessibility (depending on total number of rooms) is required. In addition, 1% of the rooms must have roll-in showers.\n\n- The proposed rule reserved the provisions on alterations to homeless shelters. The final guidelines apply alterations requirements to homeless shelters, but the requirements are less stringent than those applied to other types of facilities.\n\n- Parking spaces that can be used by people in vans (with lifts) will be required.\n\n- As mandated by the ADA, the Board has established a procedure to be followed with respect to alterations to historic facilities.\n\nSummary of ADAAG\n\nThis section of the preamble summarizes the structure of ADAAG, and highlights the more important portions.\n\n- Sections 1 Through 3\n\nSections 1 through 3 contain general requirements, including definitions.\n\n- Section 4.1.1, Application\n\nSection 4 contains scoping requirements. Section 4.1.1, Application, provides that all areas of newly designed or newly constructed buildings and facilities and altered portions of existing buildings and facilities required to be accessible by Sec.4.1.6 must comply with the guidelines unless otherwise provided in Sec.4.1.1 or a special application section. It addresses areas used only by employees as work areas, temporary structures, and general exceptions.\n\nSection 4.1.1(3) preserves the basic principle of the proposed rule: Areas that may be used by employees with disabilities shall be designed and constructed so that an individual with a disability can approach, enter, and exit the area. The language has been clarified to provide that it applies to any area used only as a work area (not just to areas \"that may be used by employees with disabilities''), and that the guidelines do not require that any area used as an individual work station be designed with maneuvering space or equipped to be accessible. The appendix to ADAAG explains that work areas must meet the guidelines' requirements for doors and accessible routes, and recommends, but does not require, that 5% of individual work stations be designed to permit a person using a wheelchair to maneuver within the space.\n\nFurther discussion of work areas is found in the preamble concerning proposed Sec.36.401(b).\n\nSection 4.1.1(5)(a) includes an exception for structural impracticability that corresponds to the one found in Sec.36.401(c) and discussed in that portion of the preamble.\n\n- Section 4.1.2, Accessible Sites and Exterior Facilities: New Construction\n\nThis section addresses exterior features, elements, or spaces such as parking, portable toilets, and exterior signage, in new construction. Interior elements and spaces are covered by Sec.4.1.\n\n3. The final rule retains the UFAS scoping for parking but also requires that at least one of every eight accessible parking spaces be designed with adequate adjacent space to deploy a lift used with a van. These spaces must have a sign indicating that they are van-accessible, but they are not to be reserved exclusively for van users.\n\n- Section 4.1.3, Accessible Buildings: New Construction\n\nThis section establishes scoping requirements for new construction of buildings and facilities.\n\nSections 4.1.3 (1) through (4) cover accessible routes, protruding objects, ground and floor surfaces, and stairs.",

    "content": "Sections 4.1.3 (1) through (4) cover accessible routes, protruding objects, ground and floor surfaces, and stairs.\n\nSection 4.1.3(5) generally requires elevators to serve each level in a newly constructed building, with four exceptions included in the subsection. Exception 1 is the \"elevator exception'' established in Sec.36.401(d), which must be read with this section. Exception 4 allows the use of platform lifts under certain conditions.\n\nUnder Sec.4.1.3(8), at least 50% of all public entrances must be accessible. In addition, if a building is designed to provide access to enclosed parking, pedestrian tunnels, or elevated walkways, at least one entrance that serves each such function must be accessible. Each tenancy in a building must be served by an accessible entrance. Where local regulations (e.g., fire codes) require that a minimum number of exits be provided, an equivalent number of accessible entrances must be provided. (The latter provision does not require a greater number of entrances than otherwise planned.)\n\nADAAG Section 4.1.3(9), with accompanying technical requirements in Section 4.3, requires an area of rescue assistance (i.e., an area with direct access to an exit stairway and where people who are unable to use stairs may await assistance during an emergency evacuation) to be established on each floor of a multi-story building. This was one of the most controversial provisions in the guidelines. The final ADAAG is based on current Uniform Building Code requirements and retains the requirement that areas of refuge (renamed \"areas of rescue assistance'') be provided, but specifies that this requirement does not apply to buildings that have a supervised automatic sprinkler system. Areas of refuge are not required in alterations.\n\nThe next seven subsections deal with drinking fountains (Sec.4.1.3(10)); toilet facilities (Sec.4.1.3(11)); storage, shelving, and display units (Sec.4.1.3(12)), controls and operating mechanisms (Sec.4.1.3(13)), emergency warning systems (Sec.4.1.3(14)), detectable warnings (Sec.4.1.3(15)), and building signage (Sec.4.1.3(16)). Paragraph 11 requires that toilet facilities comply with Sec.4.22, which requires one accessible toilet stall (600A60) in each newly constructed restroom. In response to public comments, the final rule requires that a second accessible stall (360A60) be provided in restrooms that have six or more stalls.\n\nADAAG Section 4.1.3(17) establishes requirements for accessibility of pay phones to persons with mobility impairments, hearing impairments (requiring some phones with volume controls), and those who cannot use voice telephones. It requires one interior \"text telephone'' to be provided at any facility that has a total of four or more public pay phones. (The term \"text telephone'' has been adopted to reflect current terminology and changes in technology.) In addition, text telephones will be required in specific locations, such as covered shopping malls, hospitals (in emergency rooms, waiting rooms, and recovery areas), and convention centers.\n\nParagraph 18 of Section 4.1.3 generally requires that at least five percent of fixed or built-in seating or tables be accessible.\n\nParagraph 19, covering assembly areas, specifies the number of wheelchair seating spaces and types and numbers of assistive listening systems required. It requires dispersal of wheelchair seating locations in facilities where there are more than 300 seats. The guidelines also require that at least one percent of all fixed seats be aisle seats without armrests (or with moveable armrests) on the aisle side to increase accessibility for persons with mobility impairments who prefer to transfer from their wheelchairs to fixed seating. In addition, the final ADAAG requires that fixed seating for a companion be located adjacent to each wheelchair location.\n\nParagraph 20 requires that where automated teller machines are provided, at least one must comply with section 4.34, which, among other things, requires accessible controls, and instructions and other information that are accessible to persons with sight impairments.\n\nUnder paragraph 21, where dressing rooms are provided, five percent or at least one must comply with section 4.\n\n35. - Section 4.1.5, Additions\n\nEach addition to an existing building or facility is regarded as an alteration subject to Sec..36.402 through 36.406 of subpart D, including the date established in Sec.36.402(a). But additions also have attributes of new construction, and to the extent that a space or element in the addition is newly constructed, each new space or element must comply with the applicable scoping provisions of sections 4.1.1 to 4.1.3 for new construction, the applicable technical specifications of sections 4.2 through 4.34, and any applicable special provisions in sections 5 through 10. For instance, if a restroom is provided in the addition, it must comply with the requirements for new construction. Construction of an addition does not, however, create an obligation to retrofit the entire existing building or facility to meet requirements for new construction. Rather, the addition is to be regarded as an alteration and to the extent that it affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function, the requirements in section 4.1.6(2) are triggered with respect to providing an accessible path of travel to the altered area and making the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area accessible. For example, if a museum adds a new wing that does not have a separate entrance as part of the addition, an accessible path of travel would have to be provided through the existing building or facility unless it is disproportionate to the overall cost and scope of the addition as established in Sec.36.403(f).\n\n- Section 4.1.6, Alterations\n\nAn alteration is a change to a building or facility that affects or could affect the usability of or access to the building or facility or any part thereof. There are three general principles for alterations. First, if any existing element or space is altered, the altered element or space must meet new construction requirements (section 4.1.6(1)(b)). Second, if alterations to the elements in a space when considered together amount to an alteration of the space, the entire space must meet new construction requirements (section 4.1.6(1)(c)). Third, if the alteration affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function, the path of travel to the altered area and the restrooms, drinking fountains, and telephones serving the altered area must be made accessible unless it is disproportionate to the overall alterations in terms of cost and scope as determined under criteria established by the Attorney General (Sec.4.1.6(2)).\n\nSection 4.1.6 should be read with Sec..36.402 through 36.\n\n405. Requirements concerning alterations to an area serving a primary function are addressed with greater detail in the latter sections than in section 4.1.6(2). Section 4.1.6(1)(j) deals with technical infeasibility. Section 4.1.6(3) contains special technical provisions for alterations to existing buildings and facilities.\n\n- Section 4.1.7, Historic Preservation\n\nThis section contains scoping provisions and alternative requirements for alterations to qualified historic buildings and facilities. It clarifies the procedures under the National Historic Preservation Act and their application to alterations covered by the ADA. An individual seeking to alter a facility that is subject to the ADA guidelines and to State or local historic preservation statutes shall consult with the State Historic Preservation Officer to determine if the planned alteration would threaten or destroy the historic significance of the facility.",

The technical specifications are the same as the 1980 version of ANSI A117.1 standard, except as noted in the text by italics.\n\n- Sections 5 Through 9\n\nThese are special application sections and contain additional requirements for restaurants and cafeterias, medical care facilities, business and mercantile facilities, libraries, and transient lodging. For example, at least 5 percent, but not less than one, of the fixed tables in a restaurant must be accessible.\n\nIn section 7, Business and Mercantile, paragraph 7.2 (Sales and Service Counters, Teller Windows, Information Counters) has been revised to provide greater flexibility in new construction than did the proposed rule. At least one of each type of sales or service counter where a cash register is located shall be made accessible. Accessible counters shall be dispersed throughout the facility. At counters such as bank teller windows or ticketing counters, alternative methods of compliance are permitted. A public accommodation may lower a portion of the counter, provide an auxiliary counter, or provide equivalent facilitation through such means as installing a folding shelf on the front of the counter at an accessible height to provide a work surface for a person using a wheelchair.\n\nSection 7.3., Check-out Aisles, provides that, in new construction, a certain number of each design of check-out aisle, as listed in a chart based on the total number of check-out aisles of each design, shall be accessible. The percentage of check-outs required to be accessible generally ranges from 20% to 40%. In a newly constructed or altered facility with less than 5,000 square feet of selling space, at least one of each type of check-out aisle must be accessible. In altered facilities with 5,000 or more square feet of selling space, at least one of each design of check-out aisle must be made accessible when altered, until the number of accessible aisles of each design equals the number that would be required for new construction.\n\n- Section 9, Accessible Transient Lodging\n\nSection 9 addresses two types of transient lodging: hotels, motels, inns, boarding houses, dormitories, resorts, and other similar places (sections 9.1 through 9.4); and homeless shelters, halfway houses, transient group homes, and other social service establishments (section 9.5). The interplay of the ADA and Fair Housing Act with respect to such facilities is addressed in the preamble discussion of the definition of \"place of public accommodation'' in Sec.36.\n\n104. The final rule establishes scoping requirements for accessibility of newly constructed hotels. Four percent of the first hundred rooms, and roughly two percent of rooms in excess of 100, must meet certain requirements for accessibility to persons with mobility or hearing impairments, and an additional identical percentage must be accessible to persons with hearing impairments. An additional 1% of the available rooms must be equipped with roll-in showers, raising the actual scoping for rooms accessible to persons with mobility impairments to 5% of the first hundred rooms and 3% thereafter. The final ADAAG also provides that when a hotel is being altered, one fully accessible room and one room equipped with visual alarms, notification devices, and amplified telephones shall be provided for each 25 rooms being altered until the number of accessible rooms equals that required under the new construction standard. Accessible rooms must be dispersed in a manner that will provide persons with disabilities with a choice of single or multiple-bed accommodations.\n\nIn new construction, homeless shelters and other social service entities must comply with ADAAG; at least one type of amenity in each common area must be accessible. In a facility that is not required to have an elevator, it is not necessary to provide accessible amenities on the inaccessible floors if at least one of each type of amenity is provided in accessible common areas. The percentage of accessible sleeping accommodations required is the same as that required for other places of transient lodging. Requirements for facilities altered for use as a homeless shelter parallel the current MGRAD accessibility requirements for leased buildings. A shelter located in an altered facility must have at least one accessible entrance, accessible sleeping accommodations in a number equivalent to that established for new construction, at least one accessible toilet and bath, at least one accessible common area, and an accessible route connecting all accessible areas. All accessible areas in a homeless shelter in an altered facility may be located on one level.\n\nSection 10, Transportation Facilities\n\nSubpart E -- Enforcement\n\nBecause the Department of Justice does not have authority to establish procedures for judicial review and enforcement, subpart E generally restates the statutory procedures for enforcement.\n\nSection 36.501 describes the procedures for private suits by individuals and the judicial remedies available. In addition to the language in section 308(a)(1) of the Act, Sec.36.501(a) of this part includes the language from section 204(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a - 3(a)) which is incorporated by reference in the ADA. A commenter noted that the proposed rule did not include the provision in section 204(a) allowing the court to appoint an attorney for the complainant and authorize the commencement of the civil action without the payment of fees, costs, or security. That provision has been included in the final rule.\n\nSection 308(a)(1) of the ADA permits a private suit by an individual who has reasonable grounds for believing that he or she is \"about to be'' subjected to discrimination in violation of section 303 of the Act (subpart D of this part), which requires that new construction and alterations be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. Authorizing suits to prevent construction of facilities with architectural barriers will avoid the necessity of costly retrofitting that might be required if suits were not permitted until after the facilities were completed. To avoid unnecessary suits, this section requires that the individual bringing the suit have `reasonable grounds'' for believing that a violation is about to occur, but does not require the individual to engage in a futile gesture if he or she has notice that a person or organization covered by title III of the Act does not intend to comply with its provisions.",

The Report of the Energy and Commerce Committee notes that \"an order to make a facility readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities is mandatory'' under this standard. H.R. Rep. No. 485, 101st Cong., 2d Sess, pt 4, at 64 (1990). Also, injunctive relief shall include, where appropriate, requiring the provision of an auxiliary aid or service, modification of a policy, or provision of alternative methods, to the extent required by title III of the Act and this part.\n\nSection 36.502 is based on section 308(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, which provides that the Attorney General shall investigate alleged violations of title III and undertake periodic reviews of compliance of covered entities. Although the Act does not establish a comprehensive administrative enforcement mechanism for investigation and resolution of all complaints received, the legislative history notes that investigation of alleged violations and periodic compliance reviews are essential to effective enforcement of title III, and that the Attorney General is expected to engage in active enforcement and to allocate sufficient resources to carry out this responsibility. Judiciary Report at 67.\n\nMany commenters argued for inclusion of more specific provisions for administrative resolution of disputes arising under the Act and this part in order to promote voluntary compliance and avoid the need for litigation. Administrative resolution is far more efficient and economical than litigation, particularly in the early stages of implementation of complex legislation when the specific requirements of the statute are not widely understood. The Department has added a new paragraph (c) to this section authorizing the Attorney General to initiate a compliance review where he or she has reason to believe there may be a violation of this rule.\n\nSection 36.503 describes the procedures for suits by the Attorney General set out in section 308(b)(1)(B) of the Act. If the Department has reasonable cause to believe that any person or group of persons is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of any of the rights granted by title III or that any person or group of persons has been denied any of the rights granted by title III and such denial raises an issue of general public importance, the Attorney General may commence a civil action in any appropriate United States district court. The proposed rule provided for suit by the Attorney General \"or his or her designee.'' The reference to a \"designee'' has been omitted in the final rule because it is unnecessary. The Attorney General has delegated enforcement authority under the ADA to the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. 55 FR 40653 (1990-10-04) (to be codified at 28 CFR 0.50(l).)\n\nSection 36.504 describes the relief that may be granted in a suit by the Attorney General under section 308(b)(2) of the Act. In such an action, the court may grant any equitable relief it considers to be appropriate, including granting temporary, preliminary, or permanent relief, providing an auxiliary aid or service, modification of policy or alternative method, or making facilities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, to the extent required by title III. In addition, a court may award such other relief as the court considers to be appropriate, including monetary damages to persons aggrieved, when requested by the Attorney General.\n\nFurthermore, the court may vindicate the public interest by assessing a civil penalty against the covered entity in an amount not exceeding $50,000 for a first violation and not exceeding $100,000 for any subsequent violation. Section 36.504(b) of the rule adopts the standard of section 308(b)(3) of the Act. This section makes it clear that, in counting the number of previous determinations of violations for determining whether a \"first'' or \"subsequent'' violation has occurred, determinations in the same action that the entity has engaged in more than one discriminatory act are to be counted as a single violation. A \"second violation'' would not accrue to that entity until the Attorney General brought another suit against the entity and the entity was again held in violation. Again, all of the violations found in the second suit would be cumulatively considered as a \"subsequent violation.''\n\nSection 36.504(c) clarifies that the terms \"monetary damages'' and \"other relief'' do not include punitive damages. They do include, however, all forms of compensatory damages, including out-of-pocket expenses and damages for pain and suffering.\n\nSection 36.504(a)(3) is based on section 308(b)(2)(C) of the Act, which provides that, \"to vindicate the public interest,'' a court may assess a civil penalty against the entity that has been found to be in violation of the Act in suits brought by the Attorney General. In addition, Sec.36.504(d), which is taken from section 308(b)(5) of the Act, further provides that, in considering what amount of civil penalty, if any, is appropriate, the court shall give consideration to \"any good faith effort or attempt to comply with this part.'' In evaluating such good faith, the court shall consider \"among other factors it deems relevant, whether the entity could have reasonably anticipated the need for an appropriate type of auxiliary aid needed to accommodate the unique needs of a particular individual with a disability.''\n\nThe \"good faith'' standard referred to in this section is not intended to imply a willful or intentional standard --that is, an entity cannot demonstrate good faith simply by showing that it did not willfully, intentionally, or recklessly disregard the law. At the same time, the absence of such a course of conduct would be a factor a court should weigh in determining the existence of good faith.\n\nSection 36.505 states that courts are authorized to award attorneys fees, including litigation expenses and costs, as provided in section 505 of the Act. Litigation expenses include items such as expert witness fees, travel expenses, etc. The Judiciary Committee Report specifies that such items are included under the rubric of \"attorneys fees'' and not \"costs'' so that such expenses will be assessed against a plaintiff only under the standard set forth in Christiansburg Garment Co.\n\nv. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 434 U.S. 412 (1978). (Judiciary report at 73.)\n\nSection 36.506 restates section 513 of the Act, which encourages use of alternative means of dispute resolution. Section 36.507 explains that, as provided in section 506(e) of the Act, a public accommodation or other private entity is not excused from compliance with the requirements of this part because of any failure to receive technical assistance.\n\nSection 36.305 Effective Date",

    "content": "Section 36.305 Effective Date\n\nIn general, title III is effective 18 months after enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act, i.e., 1992-01-26. However, there are several exceptions to this general rule contained throughout title III. Section 36.508 sets forth all of these exceptions in one place.\n\nParagraph (b) contains the rule on civil actions. It states that, except with respect to new construction and alterations, no civil action shall be brought for a violation of this part that occurs before 1992-07-26, against businesses with 25 or fewer employees and gross receipts of $1,000,000 or less; and before 1993-01-26, against businesses with 10 or fewer employees and gross receipts of $500,000 or less. In determining what constitutes gross receipts, it is appropriate to exclude amounts collected for sales taxes.\n\nParagraph (c) concerns transportation services provided by public accommodations not primarily engaged in the business of transporting people. The 18-month effective date applies to all of the transportation provisions except those requiring newly purchased or leased vehicles to be accessible. Vehicles subject to that requirement must be accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities if the solicitation for the vehicle is made on or after 1990-08-26.\n\nSubpart F -- Certification of State Labs or Local Building Codes\n\nSubpart F establishes procedures to implement section 308(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Act, which provides that, on the application of a State or local government, the Attorney General may certify that a State law or local building code or similar ordinance meets or exceeds the minimum accessibility requirements of the Act. In enforcement proceedings, this certification will constitute rebuttable evidence that the law or code meets or exceeds the ADA's requirements.\n\nThree significant changes, further explained below, were made from the proposed subpart, in response to comments. First, the State or local jurisdiction is required to hold a public hearing on its proposed request for certification and to submit to the Department, as part of the information and materials in support of a request for certification, a transcript of the hearing. Second, the time allowed for interested persons and organizations to comment on the request filed with the Department (Sec.36.605(a)(1)) has been changed from 30 to 60 days. Finally, a new Sec.36.608, Guidance concerning model codes, has been added.\n\nSection 36.601 establishes the definitions to be used for purposes of this subpart. Two of the definitions have been modified, and a definition of \"model code'' has been added. First, in response to a comment, a reference to a code \"or part thereof'' has been added to the definition of \"code.'' The purpose of this addition is to clarify that an entire code need not be submitted if only part of it is relevant to accessibility, or if the jurisdiction seeks certification of only some of the portions that concern accessibility. The Department does not intend to encourage \"piecemeal'' requests for certification by a single jurisdiction. In fact, the Department expects that in some cases, rather than certifying portions of a particular code and refusing to certify others, it may notify a submitting jurisdiction of deficiencies and encourage a reapplication that cures those deficiencies, so that the entire code can be certified eventually. Second, the definition of \"submitting official'' has been modified. The proposed rule defined the submitting official to be the State or local official who has principal responsibility for administration of a code. Commenters pointed out that in some cases more than one code within the same jurisdiction is relevant for purposes of certification. It was also suggested that the Department allow a State to submit a single application on behalf of the State, as well as on behalf of any local jurisdictions required to follow the State accessibility requirements. Consistent with these comments, the Department has added to the definition language clarifying that the official can be one authorized to submit a code on behalf of a jurisdiction.\n\nA definition of \"model code'' has been added in light of new Sec.36.\n\n608. Most commenters generally approved of the proposed certification process. Some approved of what they saw as the Department's attempt to bring State and local codes into alignment with the ADA. A State agency said that this section will be the backbone of the intergovernmental cooperation essential if the accessibility provisions of the ADA are to be effective.\n\nSome comments disapproved of the proposed process as timeconsuming and laborious for the Department, although some of these comments pointed out that, if the Attorney General certified model codes on which State and local codes are based, many perceived problems would be alleviated. (This point is further addressed by new Sec.36.608.)\n\nMany of the comments received from business organizations, as well as those from some individuals and disability rights groups, addressed the relationship of the ADA requirements and their enforcement, to existing State and local codes and code enforcement systems. These commenters urged the Department to use existing code-making bodies for interpretations of the ADA, and to actively participate in the integration of the ADA into the text of the national model codes that are adopted by State and local enforcement agencies. These issues are discussed in preamble section 36.406 under General comments.\n\nMany commenters urged the Department to evaluate or certify the entire code enforcement system (including any process for hearing appeals from builders of denials by the building code official of requests for variances, waivers, or modifications). Some urged that certification not be allowed in jurisdictions where waivers can be granted, unless there is a clearly identified decision-making process, with written rulings and notice to affected parties of any waiver or modification request. One commenter urged establishment of a dispute resolution mechanism, providing for interpretation (usually through a building official) and an administrative appeals mechanism (generally called Boards of Appeal, Boards of Construction Appeals, or Boards of Review), before certification could be granted.\n\nThe Department thoroughly considered these proposals but has declined to provide for certification of processes of enforcement or administration of State and local codes. The statute clearly authorizes the Department to certify the codes themselves for equivalency with the statute; it would be ill-advised for the Department at this point to inquire beyond the face of the code and written interpretations of it. It would be inappropriate to require those jurisdictions that grant waivers or modifications to establish certain procedures before they can apply for certification, or to insist that no deviations can be permitted. In fact, the Department expects that many jurisdictions will allow slight variations from a particular code, consistent with ADAAG itself. ADAAG includes in Sec.2.2 a statement allowing departures from particular requirements where substantially equivalent or greater access and usability is provided. Several sections specifically allow for alternative methods providing equivalent facilitation and, in some cases, provide examples. (See, e.g., section 4.31.9, Text Telephones; section 7.2(2) (iii), Sales and Service Counters.) Section 4.1.6 includes less stringent requirements that are permitted in alterations, in certain circumstances.",

Section 4.1.6 includes less stringent requirements that are permitted in alterations, in certain circumstances.\n\nHowever, in an attempt to ensure that it does not certify a code that in practice has been or will be applied in a manner that defeats its equivalency with the ADA, the Department will require that the submitting official include, with the application for certification, any relevant manuals, guides, or any other interpretive information issued that pertain to the code. (Sec.36.603(c)(1).) The requirement that this information be provided is in addition to the NPRM's requirement that the official provide any pertinent formal opinions of the State Attorney General or the chief legal officer of the jurisdiction.\n\nThe first step in the certification process is a request for certification, filed by a \"submitting official'' (Sec.36.603). The Department will not accept requests for certification until after 1992-01-26, the effective date of this part. The Department received numerous comments from individuals and organizations representing a variety of interests, urging that the hearing required to be held by the Assistant Attorney General in Washington, DC, after a preliminary determination of equivalency (Sec.36.605(a)(2)), be held within the State or locality requesting certification, in order to facilitate greater participation by all interested parties. While the Department has not modified the requirement that it hold a hearing in Washington, it has added a new subparagraph 36.603(b)(3) requiring a hearing within the State or locality before a request for certification is filed. The hearing must be held after adequate notice to the public and must be on the record; a transcript must be provided with the request for certification. This procedure will insure input from the public at the State or local level and will also insure a Washington, DC, hearing as mentioned in the legislative history.\n\nThe request for certification, along with supporting documents (Sec.36.603(c)), must be filed in duplicate with the office of the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. The Assistant Attorney General may request further information. The request and supporting materials will be available for public examination at the office of the Assistant Attorney General and at the office of the State or local agency charged with administration and enforcement of the code. The submitting official must publish public notice of the request for certification.\n\nNext, under Sec.36.604, the Assistant Attorney General's office will consult with the ATBCB and make a preliminary determination to either (1) find that the code is equivalent (make a \"preliminary determination of equivalency'') or (2) deny certification. The next step depends on which of these preliminary determinations is made.\n\nIf the preliminary determination is to find equivalency, the Assistant Attorney General, under Sec.36.605, will inform the submitting official in writing of the preliminary determination and publish a notice in the Federal Register informing the public of the preliminary determination and inviting comment for 60 days. (This time period has been increased from 30 days in light of public comment pointing out the need for more time within which to evaluate the code.) After considering the information received in response to the comments, the Department will hold an hearing in Washington. This hearing will not be subject to the formal requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. In fact, this requirement could be satisfied by a meeting with interested parties. After the hearing, the Assistant Attorney General's office will consult again with the ATBCB and make a final determination of equivalency or a final determination to deny the request for certification, with a notice of the determination published in the Federal Register.\n\n1If the preliminary determination is to deny certification, there will be no hearing (Sec.36.606). The Department will notify the submitting official of the preliminary determination, and may specify how the code could be modified in order to receive a preliminary determination of equivalency. The Department will allow at least 15 days for the submitting official to submit relevant material in opposition to the preliminary denial. If none is received, no further action will be taken. If more information is received, the Department will consider it and make either a final decision to deny certification or a preliminary determination of equivalency. If at that stage the Assistant Attorney General makes a preliminary determination of equivalency, the hearing procedures set out in Sec.36.605 will be followed.\n\nSection 36.607 addresses the effect of certification. First, certification will only be effective concerning those features or elements that are both (1) covered by the certified code and (2) addressed by the regulations against which they are being certified. For example, if children's facilities are not addressed by the Department's standards, and the building in question is a private elementary school, certification will not be effective for those features of the building to be used by children. And if the Department's regulations addressed equipment but the local code did not, a building's equipment would not be covered by the certification.\n\nIn addition, certification will be effective only for the particular edition of the code that is certified. Amendments will not automatically be considered certified, and a submitting official will need to reapply for certification of the changed or additional provisions.\n\nCertification will not be effective in those situations where a State or local building code official allows a facility to be constructed or altered in a manner that does not follow the technical or scoping provisions of the certified code. Thus, if an official either waives an accessible element or feature or allows a change that does not provide equivalent facilitation, the fact that the Department has certified the code itself will not stand as evidence that the facility has been constructed or altered in accordance with the minimum accessibility requirements of the ADA. The Department's certification of a code is effective only with respect to the standards in the code; it is not to be interpreted to apply to a State or local government's application of the code. The fact that the Department has certified a code with provisions concerning waivers, variances, or equivalent facilitation shall not be interpreted as an endorsement of actions taken pursuant to those provisions.\n\nThe final rule includes a new Sec.36.608 concerning model codes. It was drafted in response to concerns raised by numerous commenters, many of which have been discussed under General comments (Sec.36.406). It is intended to assist in alleviating the difficulties posed by attempting to certify possibly tens of thousands of codes. It is included in recognition of the fact that many codes are based on, or incorporate, model or consensus standards developed by nationally recognized organizations (e.g., the American National Standards Institute (ANSI); Building Officials and Code Administrators (BOCA) International; Council of American Building Officials (CABO) and its Board for the Coordination of Model Codes (BCMC); Southern Building Code Congress International (SBCCI)). While the Department will not certify or \"precertify'' model codes, as urged by some commenters, it does wish to encourage the continued viability of the consensus and model code process consistent with the purposes of the ADA.",

The review process will be informal and will not be subject to the procedures of Sec..36.602 through 36.\n\n607. The result of the review will take the form of guidance from the Assistant Attorney General as to whether and in what respects the model code is consistent with the ADA's requirements. The guidance will not be binding on any entity or on the Department; it will assist in evaluations of individual State or local codes and may serve as a basis for establishing priorities for consideration of individual codes. The Department anticipates that this approach will foster further cooperation among various government levels, the private entities developing standards, and individuals with disabilities.\n\ndivider\n2014-03-04",

PURPOSE\n2. EXPLANATION\n3. PRINCIPLE\n4. RECOMMENDATION\n5. PARTS\n8-6 CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION\n8-7 AUTHORITY\n8-8 NOTICES\n8-9 REMEDIES\n1. PURPOSE\nThe purpose of this Annex is to set forth provisions, in codified form, that provide a full\narray of enforcement mechanisms while recognizing the diverse statutes and\nregulations that currently govern the operations of the thousands of State and local\nregulatory agencies.\n\n2. EXPLANATION\nState or local statutes, regulations, and ordinances vary in their design, specificity, and\ndegree of comprehensiveness in that they may:\n(A) Contain authorities that provide the basis for certain post-inspection\ncompliance strategies but remain silent with respect to other enforcement\nmechanisms;\n(B) Include specific requirements that are different from those provided in this\nAnnex; and\n(C) Be structured so that provisions such as administrative procedures are\nembodied in sections of the law that transcend and are separate from those\ngoverning food establishments.\nAnnex 1 \u2013 Compliance & Enforcement\n\nConsequently, in this document a deliberate attempt is made to extract those provisions\nthat could conceptually be adopted as an extension of Chapter 8 if they were\ncompatible with existing, governing State and local statutes. The extracted provisions\nare numbered to sequentially follow Chapter 8 but are placed in this Annex so that\nregulatory agencies can revise them to be consistent with their statutes and their needs\nas discussed in the Recommendation, below.\nIt is anticipated that adoption of this Code will be facilitated by the fact that:\n(A) The compliance provisions of Chapter 8 that should be an integral part of\nState or local food regulations are part of the text of the Code; and\n(B) The administrative and judicial enforcement provisions that are critical to the\nframework of a food regulatory program, but that may be repetitive or discrepant\nwhen compared to State or local statutes, are separated in this Annex.\n\n3. PRINCIPLE\nAlthough the situations necessitating escalated enforcement actions comprise a small\npercentage of those encountered by the regulator, a full spectrum of enforcement tools\nmust be available where immediate hazards exist, or where compliance is not obtained\nvoluntarily. Thus, a jurisdiction must have in place both the necessary statutory\nframework that includes a broad-based, well-defined enforcement component and\nregulations that specify the requirements within those legal authorities. It is imperative\nthat there be clearly stated and legally sound rules that include the criteria for\ncompliance and enforcement, the responsibilities of all parties, sanctions for\nnoncompliance, and due process guarantees.\n\n4. RECOMMENDATION\nFDA recommends that agencies assess their statutory provisions that pertain to food\nestablishments in light of this Annex and consider proposing changes to their statutes\nand regulations where they determine that provisions contained within this Annex will\nstrengthen their programs. Such an assessment may involve reviewing problems\nencountered in attempts to prosecute under existing State or local provisions;\nconsidering comments received by the regulatory authority about its enforcement\nprocess; consulting with staff and legal counsel to identify gaps or weaknesses in the\nprovisions; comparing provisions with sister agencies for comprehensiveness, equity,\nand uniformity; and seeking input from outside sources that have experience in taking,\nor being the subject of, enforcement actions.\nAnnex 1 \u2013 Compliance & Enforcement\n\n 8-601 Procedural Safeguards\n 8-602 Judicial Review\nAppropriate wording and cross referencing changes to the provisions in this Annex may\nbe necessary, based on whether they are adopted as statutes or regulations.\nModifications to the adoption forms (Forms #2-A and #2-B in Annex 7) may also be\nnecessary based on that decision.\nParts\n8-6 CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION\n8-7 AUTHORITY\n8-8 NOTICES\n8-9 REMEDIES\n8-6 CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION\nSubparts\nProcedural\nSafeguards",

The purposes of these standards are:\n\uf0d8 To serve as a bench mark to retail food regulatory program managers in\nthe design and management of a retail food program;\n\uf0d8 To provide a means of recognition of programs meeting these\nstandards;\n\uf0d8 To promote uniformity in retail food programs to reduce the risk factors\nknown to cause foodborne illness;\n\uf0d8 To provide a foundation for the food regulatory program that is focused\non the risk factors and other factors that may contribute to foodborne\nillness; and\n\uf0d8 To promote, through the management of a retail food regulatory\nprogram, the active managerial control in the retail establishment of all\nthe factors that may cause foodborne illness.\nFurther purposes of these standards are to serve as a guide to regulatory retail food\nprogram managers in the design and management of a retail food program and to\nprovide a means of recognition for those programs that meet these standards.\nThe intent in the development of these standards is to establish a basic foundation in\ndesign and management of a retail food program. Program management may add\nadditional requirements to meet individual program needs.\nAnnex 2 \u2013 References\n\nThe standards apply to the operation and management of a regulatory retail food\nprogram focused on the reduction of risk factors known to cause foodborne illness as\nwell as other factors that may contribute to foodborne illness and on the promotion of\nactive managerial control of all factors that may cause foodborne illness.\nB.\t FDA Procedures for Standardization and Certification of Retail Food\nInspection/Training Officers\nThis document can be found by accessing the following web site:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/InspectionsQualityA\nssurance/ucm2006814.htm. This is a procedure that integrates the assessment of an\nindividual's knowledge, skills, and abilities in a manageable number of inspections while\npreserving the quality and integrity of the process. At the same time, we continue to\nlearn from our experiences in applying it and remain open to improving these\nProcedures based on your experiences and feedback.\nAs they are written, the Procedures address the situation wherein an FDA Standard is\nassessing a CANDIdahoATE who is not employed by FDA. For example, Paragraph\n3-301(C) mentions but does not require recording citations (i.e., identifying the codified\nprovision that relates to each observed violation). Since jurisdiction's codification\nsystems (numeric or alphanumeric) are usually different from the system in the FDA\nFood Code, the utility of that practice would be minimal in an FDA-to-jurisdiction field\nexercise. However, within a jurisdiction where the same Code is in use, the practice\ncould be useful in reinforcing diligence in ensuring that violations listed during\ninspections are, in fact, soundly based in regulation.\nFDA invites and encourages jurisdictions to use these Procedures in their internal\nStandardization and Certifications and to add dimensions that promote uniformity such\nas citing codified provisions, as discussed above. With a few language changes, the\ndocument can be custom-tailored to fit individual jurisdictions and serve as their\nprocedures. As with other documents provided as guidance for applying regulatory\nrequirements in the retail sector, these Procedures are in the \"public domain\" and we\nencourage their duplication and use.\nAnnex 2 \u2013 References",

    "content": "Annex 2 \u2013 References\n\nC.\t Managing Food Safety: A Manual for the Voluntary Use of HACCP Principles for\nOperators of Food Service and Retail Establishments\nThe Operator\u2019s Manual can be found by accessing the following web site:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/HACCP/ucm2006811.htm. FDA has\nissued guidance to industry in voluntarily applying HACCP principles in food\nestablishments. It recognizes that there are differences between using HACCP at retail\nand in food manufacturing. By incorporating the seven principles of HACCP, a good\nset of Standard Operating Procedures, and using a process approach, this Guide sets\nup a framework for the retail food industry to develop and implement a sound food\nsafety management system.\nThis document is intended to serve as a guide in the writing of a simple plan based on\nHACCP principles that can be used to manage food safety. It is very important to\nunderstand that this Guide is intended to assist industry's voluntary implementation of\nHACCP principles. It is not meant to stand alone, but instead should be used together\nwith advice from and in consultation with your Federal, State, local, or tribal food safety\nregulatory authority. The regulatory authority is an important resource for reviewing\nyour food safety management system. Regulatory food safety professionals can\nprovide important information for the public health rationale for controlling a particular\nhazard. Users of this document also need to consult and use the latest edition of the\nFDA Food Code since many of its requirements are not reproduced here but constitute\na fundamental program that is prerequisite to implementing a HACCP program.\nHazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) is a common sense technique to\ncontrol food safety hazards. It is a preventive system of hazard control rather than a\nreactive one. Food establishments can use it to ensure safer food products for\nconsumers. It is not a zero risk system, but is designed to minimize the risk of food\nsafety hazards. HACCP is not a stand alone program but is one part of a larger system\nof control procedures that must be in place in order for HACCP to function effectively.\nThese control procedures are prerequisite programs and are discussed more in\nAnnex 4.\nThe success of a HACCP program is dependent upon both people and facilities.\nManagement and employees must be properly motivated and trained if a HACCP\nprogram is to successfully reduce the risk of foodborne illness. Education and\ntraining in the principles of food safety and management commitment to the\nimplementation of a HACCP system are critical and must be continuously reinforced.\nInstilling food worker commitment and dealing with problems such as high employee\nturnover and communication barriers must be considered when designing a HACCP\nplan.\nAnnex 2 \u2013 References\n\nSuccessful implementation of a HACCP plan is also dependent upon the design and\nperformance of facilities and equipment. The likelihood of the occurrence of a hazard\nin a finished product is definitely influenced by facility and equipment design,\nconstruction, and installation that play a key role in any preventive strategy.\nThe Agency recognizes that this document has areas that need to be further clarified\nand developed with broader input and based on industry\u2019s experiences with the\npracticalities of integrating the HACCP approach in their operations. This Guide will\ncontinue to evolve and improve.\nD.\t Managing Food Safety: A Regulator\u2019s Manual for Applying HACCP Principles to\nRisk-based Retail and Food Service Inspections and Evaluating Voluntary Food\nSafety Management Systems\nThe Regulator\u2019s Manual can be found by accessing the following website:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/HACCP/ucm2006812.htm. This\ndocument provides State, local, and tribal regulatory authorities with a step-by-step\nscheme for conducting risk-based inspections based on HACCP principles to assist\nthem with identifying and assessing control of foodborne illness risk factors. In addition,\nthe manual details intervention strategies that can be developed with retail and food\nservice operators to reduce the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors. It also\nprovides recommendations for evaluating voluntarily-implemented food safety\nmanagement systems if invited to do so by industry.\nThe utilization of voluntary food safety management systems by industry and the\nincorporation of risk-based methodology into regulatory inspection programs are\nimportant elements in reaching the goals established by the Healthy People 2010\nhealth improvement strategy and FDA retail program goals.\nIn 2004, the Conference for Food Protection (CFP) endorsed both documents with a\nrecommendation that both industry and regulatory entities consider implementing the\nprinciples of the documents into their respective food safety programs. The CFP is\ncomposed of regulators, industry, academia, professional organizations, and\nconsumers whose purpose is to identify problems, formulate recommendations, and\ndevelop and implement practices that relate to food safety.\nA Federal Register notice announcing the availability of these documents was\npublished 2005-07-21 (Docket No. 2005D-0274).\nAnnex 2 \u2013 References\n\nE.\t Food Establishment Plan Review Guide\nThis document can be found at:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/IndustryandRegulat\noryAssistanceandTrainingResources/ucm101639.htm. This Food Establishment Plan\nReview document has been developed for the purpose of assisting both regulatory and\nindustry personnel in achieving greater uniformity in the plan review process. It is the\nresult of a joint effort by FDA and the Conference for Food Protection.\nPlan review of food service establishments, retail food stores, and all other food\noperations, must be maintained as a high priority by all regulatory food agencies for\nboth new and existing facilities.\nThis document has been developed to serve as a guide in facilitating greater uniformity\nand ease in conducting plan review whether your position is a regulator or an industry\nperson wishing to build or to expand. You need not be an expert to effectively complete\nthis process.\nA good review of plans helps to avoid future problems. By listing and locating\nequipment on floor plans and diagramming specifications for electrical, mechanical and\nplumbing systems, potential problems can be spotted while still on paper and\nmodifications made BEFORE costly purchases, installation and construction.\nFood establishment plan review is recognized as an important food program component\nthat allows:\n-- Regulatory agencies to ensure that food establishments are built or renovated\naccording to current regulations or rules.\n-- Industry to establish an organized and efficient flow of food.\n-- Regulatory agencies to eliminate code violations prior to construction.\nF. FDA Report on the Occurrence of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors in Selected\nInstitutional Foodservice, Restaurant, and Retail Food Store Facility Types (2004)\nIn 1998, FDA initiated a project designed to determine the incidence of foodborne\nillness risk factors in retail and food service establishments. Inspections focusing on\nthe occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors were conducted in establishments\nthroughout the United States. The results of this project are published in the 2000\nReport of the FDA Retail Food Program Database of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors,\ncommonly referred to as the \u201cFDA Baseline Report.\u201d The Baseline Report is available\nfrom FDA through the following website:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/GuidanceRegulation/UCM123546.pdf. The data\ncollection project was repeated in 2003 and the results are published in the FDA Report\non the Occurrence of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors in Selected Institutional\nAnnex 2 \u2013 References",

This second\nreport is available from FDA through the following website:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/FoodborneIllnessRi\nskFactorReduction/ucm089696.htm. An additional data collection project is planned for\n2008.\nG.\t Growing Sprouts in a Retail Food Establishment\nThis document, Growing Sprouts in a Retail Food Establishment, can be found at the\nweb site\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/ucm078758.htm .\nThere were 25 reported outbreaks associated with raw and lightly cooked seed sprouts\nin the United States between January 1996 and December 2003. No single treatment\nso far has been shown to completely eliminate pathogens on seeds or sprouts without\naffecting germination or yield; therefore a combination of factors is used to eliminate\nand control potential pathogens and assure a safe, ready-to-eat food product. Seeds or\nbeans grown using Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) and conditioned, transported,\nand stored according to GMPs reduce the potential for seed to serve as a source of\ncontamination. Retail Sprouting Industry Best Practices help ensure that no further\ncontamination occurs and precautionary measures are taken to prevent high levels of\nbacteria from growing on the seeds or sprouts. Seeds for sprouting or sprouts should\nreceive a chemical disinfection treatment that has been approved by EPA for reduction\nof pathogens. Other treatments such as irradiation of seeds [21 CFR 179.26(b)(10)]\nhave been approved. Because no treatments are known to completely eliminate\npathogens without adversely affecting germination or yield, microbial testing of spent\nirrigation water from the sprouting process is also necessary to verify that no pathogens\nare present. Raw sprouts are considered time/temperature control for safety food\n(TCS) and therefore, require refrigeration.\nH.\t Advisories for Retail Processing with Proper Controls and Variances for Product\nSafety\nThese documents are available for purchase at minimum cost from the Association of\nFood and Drug Officials (AFDO) at the website http://www.afdo.org/. These guides\nwere funded by USDA through the University of Florida in cooperation with Florida A&M\nUniversity and the Association of Food and Drug Officials and developed by experts\nfrom academic, regulatory, and industry areas. Nine guides help retailers and\nregulatory personnel understand the food safety controls to implement in retail food and\nfood service operations in order to process and sell safe food products.

Evaluation and Definition of Potentially Hazardous Foods\nThis document can be found at the web site\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/SafePracticesforFoodProcesses/ucm0\n94141.htm . The Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) prepared and submitted this\nreport as part of a contract with FDA. It contains responses to various questions posed\nby FDA about time/temperature control for safety food (TCS food). The IFT reviewed\nthe evolution of the term TCS and recommended a change to time/temperature control\nfor safety (TCS) food as well as a science-based framework for determining the\neffectiveness of processing technologies that formulate a food so that it is non-TCS.\nThe IFT Science and Technology Expert Panel reviewed the two protocols used by\nNSF International and the American Baking Association for determining if a food is a\nTCS and proposed an alternate approach. The report examines intrinsic factors such\nas aw, pH, redox potential, natural and added antimicrobials and competitive\nmicroorganisms, and extrinsic factors such as packaging, atmospheres, storage\nconditions, processing steps, and new preservation technologies that influence\nmicrobial growth. The report also analyzes microbial hazards related to\ntime/temperature control of foods for safety.\nThe IFT developed a framework that could be used to determine whether a food is a\nTCS food or not. Part of the framework includes two tables that consider the interaction\nof pH and aw in a food, whether the food is raw or heat-treated, and whether it is\npackaged. When further product assessment is required, the application of\nmicrobiological challenge testing (inoculation studies) is discussed along with pathogen\nmodeling programs and reformulation of the food. An extensive reference list is\nincluded in the report.\nAnnex 2 \u2013 References\n\nJ.\t The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Guide, \u201cHow to\nComply with the Americans with Disabilities Act: A Guide for Restaurants and\nOther Food Service Employers\u201d 2004-10-28\nThe guide is designed to assist restaurants and other food service employers in\ncomplying with the employment provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\nThe EEOC worked extensively with the Food and Drug Administration in developing this\nnew publication.\nAvailable online at http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/restaurant_guide.html,\nhttp://www.eeoc.gov/facts/restaurant_guide_summary.html, and www.fda.gov, the guide\ncovers such topics as how the FDA Food Code provisions about restricting and\nexcluding sick employees interact with the ADA\u2019s requirements; types of reasonable\naccommodations, including the use of service animals; and what an employer should\ndo if a charge of discrimination is filed against the employer\u2019s business.\nTitle I of the ADA, which prohibits employment discrimination against people with\ndisabilities in the private sector and State and local governments, and the Rehabilitation\nAct\u2019s prohibitions against disability discrimination in the federal government.

In the Spring of 2004, FSIS began conducting sampling and\nmicrobiological verification testing for E. coli O157:H7 in raw ground beef products at\nfederally inspected establishments, retail facilities as well as at import facilities. Some\nof the products most likely to be sampled and tested at retail facilities are:\n\u2022\t Ground beef products produced from retail steaks and roasts.\n\u2022\t Manufacturing trimmings derived at retail.\n\u2022\t Ground beef that is formulated at retail by co-mingling in-store trim and trim from\nfederally inspected establishments.\n\u2022\t Irradiated ground beef co-mingled with non-irradiated meat or poultry.\nAdditionally, ground beef products have been implicated as a transmission vehicle in\nfoodborne outbreaks of infections with pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157:H7\nand Salmonella. To facilitate product traceback and to meet regulatory requirements,\nUSDA/FSIS expects retail facilities as well as federally inspected establishments to\nmaintain and provide FSIS with access to all applicable records associated with the\nsource material used for ground beef products. In cases where USDA/FSIS identifies\nadulterated ground beef, and a product recall is necessary, grinding logs will facilitate\nidentifying the source of the product and narrowing the scope of the recall.\nFSIS recently published \u201cSanitation Guidance for Beef Grinders\u201d which contains an\nexample of a fresh ground beef production log. The guidance is located at the following\nwebsite: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/shared/PDF/Sanitation_Guidance_Beef_Grinders.pdf.\nThe following information would be used to facilitate traceback of contaminated ground\nbeef products:\n\u2022\t The manufacturer name of source material used for product produced.\n\u2022\t The type of product or description of the purchased or received article(s).\n\u2022\t The establishment information from the label of source product used such as the\nname, address, and establishment number\n\u2022\t The supplier lot numbers, product code or production or pack date of source\nmaterials used.\n\u2022\t Any other information that would be useful in the quick removal of adulterated\nproduct from the market or commerce such as time of grind, grinder sanitation\nrecords and amount (in pounds) and lot/batch numbers, production codes, name\nand package size of the products produced.\nAnnex 2 \u2013 References\n\nIn addition to the references cited above, the following references also provide\ninformation:\n\n1.

Recommended Guidelines for Permanent Outdoor Cooking Establishments, 2003\nThis document can be found at http://www.foodprotect.org/guides/ . Permanent\nOutdoor Cooking Establishments (POCE) include a wide range of facilities from\nbarbecue pits at beach resorts to campfire meals at dude ranches, pig roasts and clam\nbakes, and multi-menu food service sites in amusement and theme parks. It is\nessential that the equipment and physical facility requirements be based upon a menu\nreview of the items to be prepared, cooked, held, and served. Many of these POCEs\nare high risk operations engaging in extensive preparation of raw ingredients:\nprocesses that include the cooking, hot and cold holding, and reheating of\ntime/temperature control for safety foods. These guidelines provide the basis on which\nregulatory authorities can evaluate and permit permanent outdoor cooking\nestablishments.\nM. Comprehensive Guidelines for Food Recovery Programs\nFood recovery programs collect foods from commercial production and distribution\nchannels and redistribute them to people in need. There are food recovery efforts\ncarried out by public, private, and nonprofit organizations across the country. The\nprimary goal of food recovery programs is to collect safe and wholesome food donated\nfrom commercial sources to meet the nutritional needs of the hungry.\nWith bipartisan support, Congress passed the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food\nDonation Act in 1996. The Act is designed to encourage the donation of food and\ngrocery products to nonprofit organizations such as homeless shelters, soup kitchens,\nand churches for distribution to hungry individuals. The Bill Emerson Good Samaritan\nFood Donation Act promotes food recovery by limiting the liability of donors to instances\nof gross negligence or intentional misconduct.\nAnnex 2 \u2013 References\n\nThe Guidelines are intended to provide guidance to those who want to participate in\nfood recovery programs as donors and receiving operations as well as to those who\noversee standards compliance as regulators or peer inspectors.\nThe Guidelines also give advice on implementing a food recovery program, various\nways to contribute to food recovery programs, choosing suitable partners, and laying\nthe foundation for a successful program. This includes food safety provisions in\nalignment with the FDA Food Code, guidelines for monitoring food recovery programs,\nand handling of donations of game animals. For simple recordkeeping, the Guidelines\ncontain sample forms designed to facilitate the management of a variety of aspects of\nfood recovery programs.\nFor in-depth information, see the Comprehensive Guidelines for Food\nRecovery Programs available via the Conference for Food Protection web page at\nhttp://www.foodprotect.org/guides/\nN. Retail Food Protection Program Information Manual: Storage and Handling of\nTomatoes, 2007.\nThis document can be found at the web site:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/IndustryandRegulat\noryAssistanceandTrainingResources/ucm113843.htm\nThe Retail Food Protection Program Information Manual, Storage and Handling of\nTomatoes provides safe storage and handling practices for cut tomatoes and additional\nrationale for including cut tomatoes in the definition of time/temperature control for\nsafety food in the 2005 Food Code. Historically, uncooked fruits and vegetables have\nbeen considered non-TCS food unless they were epidemiologically implicated in\nfoodborne illness outbreaks and are capable of supporting the growth of pathogenic\nbacteria in the absence of temperature control. Since 1990, at least 12 multi-state\nfoodborne illness outbreaks have been associated with different varieties of tomatoes.\nFrom 1998 \u2013 2006, outbreaks associated with tomatoes made up 17% of the producerelated outbreaks reported to FDA. Salmonella has been the pathogen of concern most\noften associated with tomato outbreaks. Recommendations are being offered to\nprevent contamination in food service facilities and retail food stores and to reduce the\ngrowth of pathogenic bacteria when contamination of fresh tomatoes may have already\noccurred (regardless of the location where the contamination occurred).\nAnnex 2 \u2013 References",

Retail Food Protection Program Information Manual: Recommendations to Food\nEstablishments for Serving or Selling Cut Leafy Greens.\nThis document can be found at:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/IndustryandRegulat\noryAssistanceandTrainingResources/ucm113843.htm.\nFollowing 24 multi-state outbreaks between 1998 and 2008, cut leafy greens was\nadded to the definition of time/temperature for safety food requiring time-temperature\ncontrol for safety (TCS). The term used in the definition includes a variety of cut\nlettuces and leafy greens. Raw agricultural commodities (RACs) that are not processed\nor cut on-site are excluded from the definition of cut leafy greens. Herbs such as\ncilantro or parsley are also not considered cut leafy greens. The pH, water activity,\navailable moisture and nutrients of cut leafy greens supports the growth of foodborne\npathogens and refrigeration at 41\u00baF (5\u00baC) or less inhibits growth and promotes general\ndie off in some pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7. Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7 and\nListeria monocytogenes, once attached to the surface or internalized into cut surfaces\nof leafy greens, are only marginally affected by chemical sanitizers.

Employee Health and Personal Hygiene Handbook\nThis document can be found at:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/IndustryandRegulat\noryAssistanceandTrainingResources/ucm113827.htm.\nThe Employee Health and Personal Hygiene Handbook was developed to\nencourage practices and behaviors that can help prevent food employees from\nspreading foodborne pathogens to food. Information is provided in a question-andanswer format and includes easy references to forms and tables that food service and\nretail food establishments and the public health community may find useful when\ntraining staff and addressing employee health and hygiene matters. This handbook\nhighlights a combination of three interventions that can be effective in prevention of the\ntransmission of foodborne viruses and bacteria in food establishments. These\ninterventions include:\n\n(a) restricting or excluding ill food employees from working with\nfood;\n\n(b) using proper handwashing procedures; and (c) eliminating bare hand contact\nwith foods that are ready-to-eat (RTE). Concurrent use of each intervention will help\nprevent the transmission of viruses, bacteria and protozoan oocysts from food\nemployees to consumers through contaminated food. Note that the\nrecommendations provided are not to be construed as medical advice or\ndirections to diagnose a medical condition.\nAnnex 2 \u2013 References\n\nThe person in charge and the food employee always have the option to seek\nprofessional medical attention as warranted by the situation at hand.\nQ. Risk Assessment Process and Spreadsheet to Redesignate Food Code Provisions\nThese documents can be found at:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/default.htm.\nFDA developed a set of definitions and a qualitative risk assessment process to\nredesignate the Food Code provisions and work with the CFP Critical Items Committee\nof stakeholders for feedback. It changed \u201ccritical\u201d and \u201cnon-critical\u201d to risk designations\nwhich include \u201cpriority item,\u201d \u201c priority foundation item\u201d and \u201ccore item\u201d to link the\nprovision to hazards associated with foodborne illness or injury. The method used is\ndescribed in \u201cRisk Assessment Process to Redesignate Food Code Provisions\u201d\nand the decision-making process recorded in the Excel spreadsheet for transparency.\nThe risk assessment decision-making process explained in the instructions provides a\nscience-based rationale for each redesignation. It is internally consistent and\nconsistent with peer-reviewed publications.\nThe process considered the general and specific hazards that each provision is\nintended to address. An initial risk designation was made based on the definitions for\n\u201cpriority item,\u201d \u201c priority foundation item\u201d, and \u201ccore item\u201d, to show how directly the\nprovision eliminated, prevented or reduced to an acceptable level, the hazards\nassociated with foodborne illness or injury. To further refine the designation, the\nvirulence or severity of the hazard in the absence of control by this Code provision was\nalso examined. Contributing factors (contamination factors, proliferating/amplification\nfactors, survival factors and method of preparation) identified for foodborne outbreaks\nreported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were also considered. The\nrisk designation was then re-evaluated in terms of meeting the definition, characteristics\nof the potential hazards, size and/or number of outbreaks caused by the hazard in\nconjunction with non-application of this Code provision and the contributing factors.\nThe final determination was based on the term which most closely defined that\nprovision, taking into account any weighting due to severity and infectivity of the hazard.\nAdditional comments and references to explain or support this determination were\nincluded on the spreadsheet.\nR. Parameters for Determining Inoculated Pack/Challenge Study Protocols\nThe National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF), in\nresponse to questions posed by FDA, developed guidelines for conducting challenge\nstudies on pathogen inhibition and inactivation studies in a variety of foods. The\nguidelines are available at:\nAnnex 2 \u2013 References\n\nhttp://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/informational/aboutfsis/!ut/p/a0/04_Sj9CPykssy0xP\nLMnMz0vMAfGjzOINAg3MDC2dDbz8LQ3dDDz9wgL9vZ2dDdz9TfQLsh0VAfb5Y5I!/?1\ndmy&current=true&urile=wcm%3Apath%3A%2Ffsiscontent%2Finternet%2Fmain%2Ftopics%2Fdata-collection-andreports%2Fnacmcf%2Fcurrent-subcommittees%2Fparameters-for-inoculated-packchallenge-study-protocols%2Fct_index9\nThe document is intended for use by the food industry, including food processors, food\nservice operators and food retailers; federal, state and local food safety regulators;\npublic health officials; food testing laboratories; and process authorities. The document\nis focused on, and limited to, bacterial inactivation and growth inhibition and does not\nmake specific recommendations with respect to public health. NACMCF concluded that\nchallenge studies should be designed considering the most current advances in\nmethodologies, current thinking on pathogens of concern, and an understanding of the\nproduct preparation, variability and storage conditions. Studies should be completed\nand evaluated under the guidance of an expert microbiologist in a qualified laboratory\nand should include appropriate statistical design and data analyses.\nThis document provides guidelines for choice of microorganisms for studies, inoculum\npreparation, inoculum level, methods of inoculation, incubation temperatures and times,\nsampling considerations, and interpreting test results. Examples of appropriately\ndesigned growth inhibition and inactivation studies are provided. The NACMCF report,\nthrough tables and appendices, also provides sources of accepted laboratory methods,\nconsiderations for selecting a laboratory, pathogens of concern with control methods for\nfood product categories, relevant Food Code definitions and food product checklists\nthat test the protocol. It also includes recommended minimum expertise for designing,\nconducting and evaluating microbiological studies; potential pathogens of concern for\ngrowth studies based on pH and aw; examples of mathematical growth and inactivation\nmodels and their application to different foods; pathogen growth ranges used in\nCommBase and Pathogen Modeling Program models; and limits for growth when other\nconditions are near optimum.\nS. The Council to Improve Foodborne Outbreak Response (CIFOR) \u2013 Guidelines for\nFoodborne Outbreak Response\nThis document can be found at: http://www.cifor.us/CIFORGuidelinesProjectMore.cfm\nThe Guidelines for Foodborne Outbreak Response describe the overall approach to\nfoodborne disease outbreaks, including preparation, detection, investigation, control\nand follow-up. The Guidelines also describe the roles of all key organizations in\nfoodborne disease outbreaks. The Guidelines are targeted at local, state and federal\nagencies that are responsible for preventing and managing foodborne disease.\nAnnex 2 \u2013 References",

This facilitates\nmaking changes to the definitions as they become necessary in subsequent editions of\nthe Food Code. The intent of the definitions to be binding in terms of the application\nand interpretation of the Code is clearly stated in Chapter 1.\nAccredited Program.\nRefer to the definition for Accredited Program in \u00b61-201.10 (B)(3).\nFood protection manager certification occurs when individuals demonstrate through a\ncertification program that they have met specified food safety knowledge standards.\nFood protection certification program accreditation occurs when certification\norganizations demonstrate through an accreditation program that they have met\nspecified program standards.\nAccreditation is a conformity assessment process through which organizations that\ncertify individuals may voluntarily seek independent evaluation and listing by an\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\naccrediting agency based upon the certifying organization=s meeting program\naccreditation standards. Such accreditation standards typically relate to such factors as\nthe certifying organization's structure, mission, policies, procedures, and the\ndefensibility of its examination processes. These standards are intended to affirm or\nenhance the quality and credibility of the certification process, minimize the potential for\nconflicts of interest, ensure fairness to candidates for certification and others, and\nthereby increase public health protection.\nProgram accreditation standards known to be relevant to food protection manager\ncertification programs include those contained in the Standards for Accreditation of\nFood Protection Manager Certification Programs available from the Conference for\nFood Protection, 2792 Miramar Lane, Lincoln, CA 95648 and found at\nhttp://www.foodprotect.org/\nAllowing food protection managers to demonstrate their required food safety knowledge\n\"through passing a test that is part of an accredited program\" is predicated on the fact\nthat their credentials have been issued by certifying organizations that have\ndemonstrated conformance with rigorous and nationally recognized program standards.\nEgg.\nThe definition of egg includes avian species\u2019 shell eggs known to be commercially\nmarketed in the United States. Also included are the eggs of quail and ratites such as\nostrich.\nNot included are baluts. Baluts are considered a delicacy among Philippine and\nVietnamese populations. They are derived from fertile eggs, typically duck eggs,\nsubjected to incubation temperatures for a period of time less than necessary for the\nembryo to hatch resulting in a partially formed embryo within the shell. Under the Egg\nProducts Inspection Act (EPIA), an egg is typically considered adulterated if it has been\nsubjected to incubation. However, in 9 CFR 590.5, baluts are specifically exempted\nfrom inspection as eggs under the EPIA.\nIn producing baluts, fertile duck eggs are incubated for approximately 18 days at a\ntemperature of 42.5\u00b0C (108.5\u00b0F) in incubators with a relatively high humidity.\n(Complete development and hatching would take place in 28 days.) Under these\nconditions, the potential for growth of transovarian Salmonella organisms such as S.\nEnteritidis within the shell, and the potential for an increase in pathogenic microflora on\nthe shell itself, are increased. Where chicken eggs are used in preparing baluts, the\nincubation period may only be 14 days at an incubation temperature of 37\u00b0C (99\u00b0F). A\nbalut is a time/temperature control for safety food subject to time/temperature\nmanagement including proper cooking and hot and cold holding. Baluts are typically\nboiled and packed in salt before sale or service.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nAlso, not included in this definition are the eggs of reptile species such as alligators and\nturtles. Alligator eggs are available for sale in some parts of the southern United\nStates. In restaurants, the menu item \u201cAlligator Eggs\u201d is sometimes made of alligator\negg, but other times is simply a fanciful name for a menu item that may include seafood\nitems such as shrimp, but contains no alligator egg.\nSea turtle eggs have been consumed in Asian and Latin American Countries.\nHowever, turtle eggs are not mentioned in the definitions section because sea turtles\n(Loggerhead, East Pacific Green, Leatherback, Hawksbill, Kemp\u2019s Ridley, and Olive\nRidley) are protected by The Endangered Species Act of 1973 and therefore may not\nbe sold or consumed. This Act, with respect to turtle eggs, is enforced by the United\nStates Department of Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, DC.\nFood establishment and food processing plant.\nFood Establishment and a food processing plant located within the same\npremises of a food establishment\nSome food businesses perform operations that provide food directly to consumers as a\n\u201cFood Establishment,\u201d and also supply food to other business entities as a \u201cFood\nProcessing Plant.\u201d Within such a business, those operations that provide food directly\nto consumers only should be considered part of a \u201cFood Establishment\u201d for the\npurposes of applying the Food Code while those operations that supply food to other\nbusiness entities may be subject to other rules and regulations that apply to \u201cFood\nProcessing Plants\u201d. It is essential that the permit holder and persons in charge be\naware that regulatory requirements and the appropriate operational practices for \u201cFood\nEstablishments\u201d may differ from those for \u201cFood Processing Plants.\u201d\nSome facilities and functions may be subject to different regulatory requirements\ndepending on whether that facility or function is regulated as a \u201cFood Establishment\u201d or\nas a \u201cFood Processing Plant\u201d, or both. Those facilities and functions within a business\nthat are shared by both the \u201cFood Establishment\u201d and \u201cFood Processing Plant\u201d\noperations, e.g., refrigeration units, dressing room and toilet facilities, food equipment,\nwater and waste systems, pest control, might be subject to similar regulatory\nrequirements. The Food Code is intended to apply to \u201cfood establishments\u201d.\nPackaged.\nThe definition of \u201cpackaged\u201d was revised in (2) to clarify when foods packaged at retail\nneed not be labeled.\nRefer to Public Health Reasons for Food Labels \u00a7 3-602.\n\n11.

    "content": "11. Annex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nTime/Temperature Control for Safety Food\nTime Temperature Control for Safety Food (TCS) is defined in terms of whether or not it\nrequires time/temperature control for safety to limit pathogen growth or toxin formation.\nThe term does not include foods that do not support growth but may contain a\npathogenic microorganism or chemical or physical food safety hazard at a level\nsufficient to cause foodborne illness or injury. The progressive growth of all foodborne\npathogens is considered whether slow or rapid.\nThe definition of TCS food takes into consideration pH, aw, pH and aw interaction, heat\ntreatment, and packaging for a relatively simple determination of whether the food\nrequires time/temperature control for safety. If the food is heat-treated to eliminate\nvegetative cells, it needs to be addressed differently than a raw product with no, or\ninadequate, heat treatment. In addition, if the food is packaged after heat treatment to\ndestroy vegetative cells and subsequently packaged to prevent re-contamination, higher\nranges of pH and/or aw can be tolerated because remaining spore-forming bacteria are\nthe only microbial hazards of concern. While foods will need to be cooled slightly to\nprevent condensation inside the package, they must be protected from contamination in\nan area with limited access and packaged before temperatures drop below 57\u00b0C\n(135\u00b0F). In some foods, it is possible that neither the pH value nor the aw value is low\nenough by itself to control or eliminate pathogen growth; however, the interaction of pH\nand aw may be able to accomplish it. This is an example of a hurdle technology.\nHurdle technology involves several inhibitory factors being used together to control or\neliminate pathogen growth, when they would otherwise be ineffective if used alone.\nWhen no other inhibitory factors are present and the pH and/or aw values are unable to\ncontrol or eliminate bacterial pathogens which may be present, growth may occur and\nfoodborne outbreaks result. Cut melons, cut tomatoes, and cut leafy greens are\nexamples where intrinsic factors are unable to control bacterial growth once pathogens\nare exposed to the cellular fluids and nutrients after cutting.\nIn determining if time/temperature control is required, combination products present\ntheir own challenge. A combination product is one in which there are two or more\ndistinct food components and an interface between the two components may have a\ndifferent property than either of the individual components. A determination must be\nmade about whether the food has distinct components such as pie with meringue\ntopping, focaccia bread, meat salads, or fettuccine alfredo with chicken or whether it\nhas a uniform consistency such as gravies, puddings, or sauces. In these products, the\npH at the interface is important in determining if the item is a TCS food.\nA well designed inoculation study or other published scientific research should be used\nto determine whether a food can be held without time/temperature control when:\n\u2022\t process technologies other than heat are applied to destroy foodborne\npathogens (e.g., irradiation, high pressure processing, pulsed light, ozonation);\n\u2022\t combination products are prepared; or\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\u2022\t other extrinsic factors (e.g., packaging/atmospheres) or intrinsic factors (e.g.,\nredox potential, salt content, antimicrobials) are used to control or eliminate\npathogen growth.\nBefore using Tables A and B in paragraph 1-201.10(B) of the definition for\n\u201ctime/temperature control for safety food\u201d in determining whether a food requires\ntime/temperature control for safety (TCS), answers to the following questions should be\nconsidered:\n\u2022\t Is the intent to hold the food without using time or temperature control?\no\t If the answer is No, no further action is required. The decision tree later in\nthis Annex is not needed to determine if the item is a TCS food.\n\u2022\t Is the food raw, or is the food heat-treated?\n\u2022\t Does the food already require time/temperature control for safety by definition in\nparagraph 1-201.10(B)?\n\u2022\t Does a product history with sound scientific rationale exist indicating a safe\nhistory of use?\n\u2022\t Is the food processed and packaged so that it no longer requires TCS such as\nultra high temperature (UHT) creamers or shelf-stable canned goods?\n\u2022\t What is the pH and aw of the food in question using an independent laboratory\nand Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) methods of analysis?\nA food designated as product assessment required (PA), in either table should be\nconsidered TCS Food until further study proves otherwise. The PA means that based\non the food\u2019s pH and aw and whether it was raw or heat-treated or packaged, it has to\nbe considered TCS until inoculation studies or some other acceptable evidence shows\nthat the food is a TCS food or not. The Food Code requires a variance request to the\nregulatory authority with the evidence that the food does not require time/temperature\ncontrol for safety.\nThe Food Code definition designates certain raw plant foods as TCS food because they\nhave been shown to support the growth of foodborne pathogens in the absence of\ntemperature control and to lack intrinsic factors that would inhibit pathogen growth.\nUnless product assessment shows otherwise, these designations are supported by\nTables A and B. For example:\nFor cut cantaloupe (pH 6.2-7.1, aw > 0.99, not heat-treated),. fresh sprouts (pH > 6.5,\naw > 0.99, not heat-treated), and cut tomatoes (pH 4.23 \u2013 5.04, aw > 0.99, not heattreated), Table B indicates that they are considered TCS Foods unless a product\nassessment shows otherwise. Maintaining these products under the temperature\ncontrol requirements prescribed in this code for TCS food will limit the growth of\npathogens that may be present in or on the food and may help prevent foodborne\nillness.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nIf a facility adjusts the pH of a food using vinegar, lemon juice, or citric acid for\npurposes other than flavor enhancement, a variance is required under \u00b6 3-502.11(C). A\nHACCP plan is required whether the food is a TCS food as in subparagraph 3-502.11\n(C)(1) or not a TCS food, as in subparagraph 3-502.11(C)(2). A standardized recipe\nvalidated by lab testing for pH and aw would be an appropriate part of the variance\nrequest with annual (or other frequency as specified by the regulatory authority)\nsamples tested to verify compliance with the conditions of the variance.\nMore information can be found in the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) Report,\n\u201cEvaluation and Definition of Potentially Hazardous Foods\u201d at\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/SafePracticesforFoodProcesses/ucm0\n94141.htm\nInstructions for using the following Decision Tree and Table A and Table B:\n\n1. Does the operator want to hold the food without using time or temperature control?\na.\t No \u2013 Continue holding the food at \u22645\u00b0C(41\u00b0F) or \u226557\u00b0C(135\u00b0F) for safety\nand/or quality.\n\nb.

During the day-to-day operation of a food establishment,\na person who is immediately available and knowledgeable in both operational and Code\nrequirements is needed to respond to questions and concerns and to resolve problems.\nIn cases where a food establishment has several departments on the premises (e.g., a\ngrocery store with deli, seafood, and produce departments) and the regulatory authority\nhas permitted those departments individually as separate food establishments, it may\nbe unnecessary from a food safety standpoint to staff each department with a separate\nPerson in Charge during periods when food is not being prepared, packaged or served.\nWhile activities such as moving food products from a refrigerated display case to the\nwalk-in refrigerator, cleaning the floors, or doing inventory when the department is not\nbusy, do take place during these times, a designated Person in Charge for multiple\ndepartments or the entire facility can oversee these operations and be ready to take\ncorrective actions if necessary.\nKnowledge 2-102.11 Demonstration.\nThe designated person in charge who is knowledgeable about foodborne disease\nprevention, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles, and Code\nrequirements is prepared to recognize conditions that may contribute to foodborne\nillness or that otherwise fail to comply with Code requirements, and to take appropriate\npreventive and corrective actions.\nThere are many ways in which the person in charge can demonstrate competency.\nMany aspects of the food operation itself will reflect the competency of that person.

In 2002 the Conference entered into\na cooperative agreement with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) to\nprovide independent third-party evaluation and accreditation of certification bodies\ndetermined to be in conformance with these Conference standards. ANSI published its\nfirst listing of accredited certifiers in 2003.\nThe Acting Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, in his address before\nthe 2004 biennial meeting of the Conference for Food Protection, commended this\nConference achievement and encouraged universal acceptance based on the\nCFP/ANSI accreditation program.\nDistributed at this meeting was the following letter addressed to the Conference Chair\nand signed by the Director of FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. The\nletter puts forth the Agency\u2019s basis for its support of universal acceptance of food\nprotection manager certifications.\n\u201cThe 2004 biennial meeting of the Conference for Food Protection is a\nfitting occasion for FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition to\ncommend the Conference for its significant achievements in support of\nState and local food safety programs.\nThe FDA in a Memorandum of Understanding recognizes the Conference\nfor Food Protection as a voluntary national organization qualified to\ndevelop standards to promote food protection. Conference\nrecommendations contribute to improvements in the model FDA Food\nCode and help jurisdictions justify, adopt and implement its provisions.\nConference mechanisms involving active participation by representatives\nof diverse stakeholder groups produce consensus standards of the\nhighest quality. An excellent example is the Conference\u2019s Standards for\nAccreditation of Food Protection Manager Certification Programs,\nand its announcement of the new on-line listing of accredited certifiers of\nindustry food protection managers. Many years in their development,\nthese Conference standards identify the essential components necessary\nfor a credible certification program. Components cover a wide range of\nrequirements such as detailed criteria for exam development and\nadministration, and responsibilities of the certification organization to\ncandidates and the public.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nFDA applauds the Conference for this significant achievement, and\nencourages agencies at all levels of government to accept certificates\nissued by listed certifiers as meeting their jurisdictions\u2019 food safety\nknowledge and certification requirements. The American National\nStandards Institute (ANSI) has independently evaluated these certification\nprograms under an agreement with the Conference for Food Protection.\nGovernments and industry widely recognize and respect ANSI as an\naccrediting organization. ANSI has found certifiers it lists as accredited\n(http://www.ansi.org/) under \u201cconformity assessment\u201d \u2013 \u201cpersonnel\ncertification accreditation\u201d to conform to the Conference\u2019s Standards for\nAccreditation of Food Protection Manager Certification Programs.*\nThe Food Code states the person in charge of a food establishment is\naccountable for developing, carrying out, and enforcing procedures aimed\nat preventing food-borne illness. Section 2-102.11 states that one means\nby which a person in charge may demonstrate required knowledge of food\nsafety is through certification as a food protection manager by passing an\nexamination that is part of an accredited program.**\nFDA encourages food regulatory authorities and others evaluating\ncredentials for food protection managers to recognize the Conference for\nFood Protection/ANSI means of accrediting certification programs. This\nprocedure provides a means for universal acceptance of individuals who\nsuccessfully demonstrate knowledge of food safety. The procedure\nprovides officials assurance that food safety certification is based on valid,\nreliable, and legally defensible criteria. In addition, universal acceptance\neliminates the inconvenience and unnecessary expense of repeating\ntraining and testing when managers work across jurisdictional boundaries.\nFDA, along with State, local, tribal, and other Federal agencies and the\nfood industry, share the responsibility for ensuring that our food supply is\nsafe. It is anticipated that this new Conference for Food Protection/ANSI\nprogram will lead to enhanced consumer protection, improve the overall\nlevel of food safety, and be an important component of a seamless\nnational food safety system.\u201d\n*The ANSI-CFP Accreditation Program list of accredited organizations utilizing the Conference for Food Protection\n(CFP) Standards may be viewed on-line by going to:\nhttps://www.ansica.org/wwwversion2/outside/ALLdirectoryListing.asp?menuIdaho=8&prgIdaho=8&status=4\n** Accredited program does not refer to training functions or educational programs.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nDuties 2-103.11 Person in Charge.\nA primary responsibility of the person in charge is to ensure compliance with Code\nrequirements. Any individual present in areas of a food establishment where food and\nfood-contact items are exposed presents a potential contamination risk. By controlling\nwho is allowed in those areas and when visits are scheduled and by assuring that all\nauthorized persons in the establishment, such as delivery, maintenance and service\npersonnel, and pest control operators, comply with the Code requirements, the person\nin charge establishes an important barrier to food contamination.\nTours of food preparation areas serve educational and promotional purposes; however,\nthe timing of such visits is critical to food safety. Tours may disrupt standard or routine\noperational procedures, and the disruption could lead to unsafe food. By scheduling\ntours during nonpeak hours the opportunities for contamination are reduced.\nWhen food and other purchased goods are delivered and placed into designated\nlocations within the food establishment during non-operating hours, the Person in\nCharge must make sure food employees inspect such product and verify that it is from\nthe appropriate supplier, is in the desired condition, and was delivered to a proper\nstorage location. Distributors deliver and place food and other goods in refrigeration\nunits, freezers, and dry storage areas for confirmation of receipt and inspection by\nemployees immediately upon arrival to the food establishment. Distributors contracted\nby the food establishment are often given a key to allow access into the establishment\noutside of normal working hours. Upon delivery, all food must be appropriately stored in\na safe and secure manner within the food establishment. For example,\ntime/temperature control for safety foods must be stored within refrigeration units and\nheld at temperatures of 41\u00b0F or below. Likewise, if the food product is frozen, it must\nbe placed into the freezer.\nTo minimize the potential for access to the food establishment and the food by an\nunauthorized person, precautions should be applied overall to the food establishment\nand especially when access to the facility is made under key access deliveries.\nAdditional information on food defense can be viewed at:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodDefense/default.htm\nFood allergy is an increasing food safety and public health issue, affecting\napproximately 4% of the U.S. population, or twelve million Americans.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines",

    "content": "Annex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nRestaurant and retail food service managers need to be aware of the serious nature of\nfood allergies, including allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, and death; to know the eight\nmajor food allergens; to understand food allergen ingredient identities and labeling; and\nto avoid cross-contact during food preparation and service. The 2008 Conference of\nFood Protection (CFP) passed Issue 2008-III-006 which provided that food allergy\nawareness should be a food safety training duty of the Person in Charge. Accordingly,\nthe Person in Charge\u2019s Duties under paragraph (M) were amended to assure the food\nsafety training of employees includes food allergy awareness in order for them to safely\nperform duties related to food allergies.\nParagraph (M) \u201cEMPLOYEES are properly trained in FOOD safety, including food allergy\nawareness, as it relates to their assigned duties\u201d allows industry to develop and\nimplement operational-specific training programs for food employees. It is not intended\nto require that all food employees pass a test that is part of an accredited program.\nParagraph (N) emphasizes the important role the Person in Charge (PIC) has in making\nsure employees properly report certain information about their health status as it relates\nto diseases that are transmitted by food. In an effort to reinforce dialogue between food\nemployees and the PIC, there must be a way to verify that food employees and\nconditional employees are informed of their responsibility to report such information.\nExamples of ways to verify that employees have been appropriately informed include:\n\u2022\t The ability to provide documentation that all food employees and conditional\nemployees are informed of their responsibility to report to management, such as\ncompletion of Form 1-B, \u201cConditional Employees or Food Employees Reporting\nAgreement\u201d in Annex 7 or other similar state or local forms containing the same\ninformation;\n\u2022\t Presenting evidence such as curriculum and attendance rosters documenting\nthat each employee has completed a training program which includes all the\ninformation required for reporting in Form 1-B;\n\u2022\t Implementation of an employee health policy that includes a system of employee\nnotification using a combination of training, signs, pocket cards or other means\nto convey all the required information (Refer to Annex 3, 2-201 Infected Food\nEmployees and Conditional Employees Practical Applications of Using Subpart\n2-201, for further guidance);\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\u2022\t Other methods that satisfactorily demonstrate that all food employees and\nconditional employees are informed of their responsibility to report to the PIC\ninformation about their health and activities as it relates to diseases that are\ntransmissible through food, as specified under \u00b62-201.11 (A)\nIn various places throughout the Code, it is specified that either written operating\nprocedures or operational plans be developed. The link between management\nresponsibility for developing and implementing the procedures or plans is now\nestablished as a new duty for the Person in Charge (PIC). This new provision does not\nestablish new requirements in the development of plans or procedures; rather it\nemphasizes the importance of the role the PIC plays in ensuring active managerial\ncontrol of the food establishment with the development and implementation of plans\nand/or procedures as specified in this Code. Examples of Code provisions that call for\nthe development of plans or procedures can be found in: \u00a7 2-501.11, \u00b6\u00b63-301.11(D) and\n3-401.14 (F), \u00a7\u00a7 3-501.19, and 5-205.\n\n14. Ultimately, responsibility for food safety at the\nretail level lies with retail and food service operators and their ability to develop and\nmaintain effective food safety management systems. There are many tools that\nindustry can use to develop an effective system to achieve active managerial control of\nfoodborne illness risk factors. An important tool in controlling risk factors inherent in a\nfood establishment is the development and implementation of written procedures or\nplans.\n(Also refer to Annex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices (1) (D) for further\ninformation).\n2-2 Employee Health\nOverall goals\nThe purpose of this section of the Food Code is to reduce the likelihood that certain\nviral and bacterial agents will be transmitted from infected food employees into food.\nThe agents of concern are known to be readily transmissible via food that has been\ncontaminated by ill food employees, and so for that reason, are the primary focus of the\nEmployee Health section of the Food Code. However, there are different levels of risk\nassociated with different levels of clinical illness. The structure of the restrictions and\nexclusions has, therefore, been designed in a tiered fashion depending on the clinical\nsituation to offer the maximum protection to public health with the minimal disruption to\nemployees and employers.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nFour levels of illness or potential illness have been identified with the first level being\nthe highest potential risk to public health and the fourth level being the lowest. The first\nlevel relates to employees who have specific symptoms (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea,\njaundice) while in the workplace. These symptoms are known to be associated\ncommonly with the agents most likely to be transmitted from infected food employees\nthrough contamination of food. The first level also relates to employees who have been\ndiagnosed with typhoid fever or an infection with hepatitis A virus (within 14 days of\nsymptoms). The second level relates to employees who have been diagnosed with the\nspecific agents that are of concern, but who are not exhibiting symptoms of disease\nbecause their symptoms have resolved. The third level relates to employees who are\ndiagnosed with the specific agents, but never develop any gastrointestinal symptoms.\nThe fourth level relates to those individuals who are clinically well but who may have\nbeen exposed to a listed pathogen and are within the normal incubation period of\ndisease.\nThe most significant degree of restriction and exclusion applies to the first level of food\nemployee illness. Infected food employees in the first level are likely to be excreting\nhigh levels of their infectious pathogen, increasing the chance of transmission to food\nproducts, and thus on to those consuming the food. The first level includes food\nemployees who are:\n\u2022\t Experiencing active symptoms of diarrhea or vomiting \u2013 with no diagnosis,\n\u2022\t Experiencing jaundice within the last 7 days-- with no diagnosis,\n\u2022\t Diagnosed with typhoid fever,\n\u2022\t Diagnosed with hepatitis A within 7 days of jaundice or 14 days of any\n\nsymptoms, or",

Peak levels of\nhepatitis A viral shedding in the feces typically occurs before symptoms appear.\nDiarrhea and vomiting are reliable indicators of infection with Norovirus, E. coli\nO157:H7 or other STEC, and Shigella spp., but are not typical symptoms of typhoid\nfever or hepatitis A. For example, employees diagnosed with typhoid fever are more\nlikely to experience constipation, rather than diarrhea. Jaundice is also not always\nreliable as an indicator of a hepatitis A infection because employees can be infected\nwith hepatitis A virus without experiencing jaundice (anicteric employees). Dark urine\nand light colored stool may be an indicator of a hepatitis A infection but may go\nunreported.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nMaximum protection to public health requires excluding food employees suffering from\ntyphoid fever, hepatitis A virus, or specific gastrointestinal symptoms associated with\ndiseases identified as likely to be transmitted through contamination of food (See\nsection 2-201.12, Tables 2-201.12 #1a and #1b in this Annex). This situation describes\nthe highest level of risk in transmitting pathogens to food, or what we would find in the\nfirst level.\nFood employees who have been diagnosed with one of the agents of concern, but are\nnot symptomatic because their symptoms have resolved, are still likely to be carrying\nthe infected agent in their intestinal tract. This makes such employees less likely to\nspread the agent into food than others who are actually symptomatic, but employees\ndiagnosed with one of the agents of concern still pose an elevated threat to public\nhealth. For this reason, there are a series of exclusions (if the employees work in\nfacilities serving highly susceptible populations (HSP)) and restrictions (for non-HSP\nfacilities) depending on the agent involved (See section 2-201.12, Table #2). This\nsituation describes the second level of risk in transmitting pathogens to food.\nDiagnosed, asymptomatic food employees who never develop symptoms are typically\nidentified during a foodborne illness outbreak investigation through microbiological\ntesting. If infected and asymptomatic employees are not microbiologically tested, they\nwill remain undetected and could therefore extend the duration of a foodborne illness\noutbreak through continued contamination of food. The Food Code provides restriction\nor exclusion guidelines for employees that are identified through microbiological testing\nwith an infection from a listed foodborne pathogen, but are otherwise asymptomatic and\nclinically well (See section 2-201.12, Table #3). The exclusion or restriction guidelines\nare applied until the identified food employees no longer present a risk for foodborne\npathogen transmission. This situation describes the third level of risk in transmitting\npathogens to food.\nSome food employees or conditional employees may report a possible exposure to an\nagent. For example, a food employee may have attended a function at which the food\nemployee ate food that was associated with an outbreak of shigellosis, but the\nemployee remains well. Such individuals fall into the category of having had a potential\nexposure and present a lower risk to public health than someone who is either\nsymptomatic or who has a definitive diagnosis. They present a level of risk to public\nhealth that is greater than if they had not had the exposure. The approach taken in the\nFood Code to food employees who have had a potential exposure is based on the\nincubation times (time between exposure and the onset of symptoms) of the various\nagents. The times chosen for restriction are the upper end of the average incubation\nperiods for the specific agents. The Food Code provides restriction guidelines for food\nemployees working in facilities serving a HSP. The reasoning is that this will restrict food\nemployees only up to the time when it is unlikely they will develop symptoms. As a\nfurther protection to public health, it is recommended that such exposed food\nemployees working in facilities not serving a HSP pay particular attention to personal\nhygiene and report the onset of any symptoms (See section 2-201.12, Table #4). This\nsituation describes the fourth level of risk in transmitting pathogens to food.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines",

The approach strikes a balance between protecting public health and the needs\nof the food employee and employer.\nThe Food Code provisions related to employee health are aimed at removing highly\ninfectious food employees from the work place. They were developed with recognition\nof the characteristics of the six important pathogens, and of the risk of disease\ntransmission associated with symptomatic and asymptomatic shedders. The provisions\nalso account for the increased risk associated with serving food to HSP\u2019s and the need\nto provide extra protection to those populations.\nThe Employee Health section was developed and revised with assistance and input\nfrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The exclusion and restriction criteria\nare based on communicable disease information, as required by the Americans with\nDisabilities Act of 1990, in the list of Pathogens Transmitted by Food Contaminated by\nInfected Persons Who Handle Food, and Modes of Transmission of Such Pathogens\nposted on CDC\u2019s website, and from the Control of Communicable Diseases Manual,\n19th Ed., David L.

Practical applications of\nthe information in Subpart 2-201 by a food establishment manager may involve using\nSubpart 2-201 as a basis for obtaining information on the health status of food\nemployees and can also be used as a basis in developing and implementing an\neffective Employee Health Policy. Regulatory officials can benefit by using the\ninformation provided below as a basis for determining compliance with Subpart 2-201\nduring a facility food safety inspection.\nThe development and effective implementation of an employee health policy based on\nthe provisions in Subpart 2-201 may help to prevent foodborne illness associated with\ncontamination of food by ill or infected food employees. The person in charge and food\nemployees should be familiar with and able to provide the following information through\ndirect dialogue or other means when interviewed by facility managers or regulatory\nofficials. Compliance must be based, however, on first hand observations or\ninformation and cannot be based solely on responses from the person in charge to\nquestions regarding hypothetical situations or knowledge of the Food Code. Also, when\ndesigning and implementing an employee health policy, the following information should\nbe considered and addressed:\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n1. Does the establishment have an Employee Health Policy? If so, are the food\nemployees aware of the employee health policy, and is it available in written\nformat and readily available for food employees?

The person in charge\nis responsible for ensuring all food employees and conditional employees are\nknowledgeable and understand their responsibility to report listed symptoms, diagnosis\nwith an illness from a listed pathogen, or exposure to a listed pathogen to the person in\ncharge. The person in charge is also responsible for reporting to the regulatory official\nif a food employee reports a diagnosis with a listed pathogen.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nThis reporting requirement is an important component of any food safety program. A\nfood employee who suffers from any of the illnesses or medical symptoms or has a\nhistory of exposure to a listed pathogen in this Code may transmit disease through the\nfood being prepared. The person in charge must first be aware that a food employee or\nconditional employee is suffering from a disease or symptom listed in the Code before\nsteps can be taken to reduce the chance of foodborne illness.\nThe person in charge may observe some of the symptoms that must be reported.\nHowever, food employees and conditional employees share a responsibility for\npreventing foodborne illness and are obligated to inform the person in charge if they are\nsuffering from any of the listed symptoms, have a history of exposure to one of the\nlisted pathogens, or have been diagnosed with an illness caused by a listed pathogen.\nFood employees must comply with restrictions or exclusions imposed upon them.\nA conditional employee is a potential food employee to whom a job offer has been\nmade, conditional on responses to subsequent medical questions or examinations.\nThe questions or examinations are designed to identify potential food employees who\nmay be suffering from a disease that can be transmitted through food and done in\ncompliance with Title 1 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. A conditional\nemployee becomes a food employee as soon as the employee begins working, even if\nonly on a restricted basis. When a conditional employee reports a listed diagnosis or\nsymptom, the person in charge is responsible for ensuring that the conditional\nemployee is prohibited from becoming a food employee until the criteria for\nreinstatement of an exclusion are met (as specified under section 2-201.13 of the Food\nCode). When a symptomatic or diagnosed conditional employee has met the same\ncriteria for reinstatement that apply to an excluded symptomatic or diagnosed food\nemployee (as specified under section 2-201.13 of the Food Code), the conditional\nemployee may then begin working as a food employee.\nReporting Symptoms:\nIn order to protect the health of consumers and employees, information concerning the\nhealth status of conditional employees and food employees must be disclosed to the\nperson in charge. The symptoms listed in the Code cover the common symptoms\nexperienced by persons suffering from the pathogens identified by CDC as\ntransmissible through food by infected food employees. A food employee suffering from\nany of the symptoms listed presents an increased risk of transmitting foodborne illness.\nThe symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, or jaundice serve as an indication that an\nindividual may be infected with a fecal-oral route pathogen, and is likely to be excreting\nhigh levels of the infectious agent. When a food employee is shedding extremely high\nnumbers of a pathogen through the stool or vomitus, there is greater chance of\ntransmitting the pathogen to food products.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nSore throat with fever serves as an indication that the individual may be infected with\nStreptococcus pyogenes. Streptococcus pyogenes causes a common infection\notherwise known as \u201cstreptococcal sore throat\u201d or \u201cstrep throat.\u201d Streptococcal sore\nthroat can spread from contaminated hands to food, which has been the source of\nexplosive streptococcal sore throat outbreaks. Previous foodborne episodes with\nstreptococcus sore throat have occurred in contaminated milk and egg products. Food\nproducts can be contaminated by infected food employees hands or from nasal\ndischarges. Untreated individuals in uncomplicated cases can be communicable for\n10-21 days, and untreated individuals with purulent discharges may be communicable\nfor weeks or months.\nLesions containing pus that may occur on a food employee\u2019s hands, as opposed to\nsuch wounds on other parts of the body, represent a direct threat for introducing\nStaphylococcus aureus into food. Consequently, a double barrier is required to cover\nhand and wrist lesions. Pustular lesions on the arms are less of a concern when usual\nfood preparation practices are employed and, therefore, a single barrier is allowed.\nHowever, if the food preparation practices entail contact of the exposed portion of the\narm with food, a barrier equivalent to that required for the hands and wrists would be\nnecessitated. Lesions on other parts of the body need to be covered; but an\nimpermeable bandage is not considered necessary for food safety purposes. Food\nemployees should be aware that hands and fingers that contact pustular lesions on\nother parts of the body or with the mucous membrane of the nose also pose a direct\nthreat for introducing Staphylococcus aureus into food.\nIf a food employee has an infected cut and bandages it and puts on a glove, the\nemployee does not have to report the infected cut to the person in charge. However, if\nthe employee does not bandage it, reporting is required.\nTitle I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)\nTitle I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) prohibits medical\nexaminations and inquiries as to the existence, nature, or severity of a disability before\nextending a conditional offer of employment. In order for the permit holder and the\nperson in charge to be in compliance with this particular aspect of the Code and the\nADA, a conditional job offer must be made before making inquiries about the applicant\u2019s\nhealth status.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines",

    "content": "Annex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nThe ADA also requires that employers provide reasonable accommodation to qualified\napplicants and employees with disabilities. A reasonable accommodation is a change\nin the application process, in the way a job is done, or to other parts of the job that\nenables a person with a disability to have equal employment opportunities. ADA\ndisabilities are serious, long-term conditions. Most people with diseases resulting from\nthe pathogens listed in the Food Code do not have ADA disabilities because these\ndiseases are usually short-term in duration. In addition, the gastrointestinal symptoms\nlisted in the Food Code usually are not long-term and severe enough, in themselves, to\nbe ADA disabilities. Of course, these symptoms may be linked to other conditions that\nmay be serious enough to be ADA disabilities, like Crohn\u2019s disease or cancer.\nA food employer may exclude any employee under the Food Code upon initially\nlearning that the employee has Salmonella Typhi, or has a gastrointestinal symptom\nlisted in the Food Code. The excluded employee may then ask for an ADA reasonable\naccommodation instead of the exclusion. In response, the employer\u2019s first step should\nbe to ask the employee to establish that the employee is disabled by the disease or\nsymptom (or that the symptom is caused by another ADA disability). If the employee\nsuccessfully proves that the employee has an ADA disability, then the employer may\ncontinue to exclude the employee under the Food Code if:\n\u2022\t there is no reasonable accommodation at work that would eliminate the\nrisk of transmitting the disease while also allowing the employee to work in\na food handling position, or\n\u2022\t all reasonable accommodations would pose an undue hardship on the\nemployer\u2019s business; and\n\u2022\t there is no vacant position not involving food handling for which the\nemployee is qualified and to which the employee can be reassigned.\nExample 1: A food employee working in the caf\u00e9 of a department store informs the\nemployer that the employee has been diagnosed with a disease caused by Salmonella\nTyphi. The employer immediately excludes the employee under the requirements of\nthe Food Code. The employee then establishes that the disease is an ADA disability\nbecause it is severe and long-term and the employee requests reasonable\naccommodation instead of an exclusion. The employer determines that no reasonable\naccommodation would eliminate the risk of transmitting Salmonella Typhi through food\nand refuses to remove the exclusion. However, there is a vacant clerical position in\nanother part of the store for which the employee is qualified. Unless the employer can\nestablish that reassigning the employee to this position would be an undue hardship,\nthe employer\u2019s failure to make the reassignment instead of continuing the exclusion\nwould be a violation of the ADA.1\n1 Whether or not the employee in question is an individual with an ADA disability, in those jurisdictions where the\nCode is adopted, Food Code exclusions or restrictions must be removed when requirements for removal under\n\u00a7 2-201.13 of the Code are met.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nExample 2: A food employee has diarrhea and is excluded. The employee establishes\nthat the diarrhea is caused by Crohn\u2019s disease. This employee also establishes a\nserious longstanding history of Crohn\u2019s disease and is an individual with an ADA\ndisability. Crohn\u2019s disease is not a communicable disease and cannot be transmitted\nthrough food. No reasonable accommodation is needed to eliminate the risk of\ntransmitting the disease through the food supply, so the Food Code exclusion should\nbe removed. Of course, the Food Code\u2019s provisions on personal cleanliness for hands\nand arms apply as usual, requiring employees to clean hands and exposed portions of\narms after using the toilet room and in other specified circumstances (Subpart 2-301).\nSomewhat different rules apply to conditional employees. If a conditional employee\nreports a disease or symptom listed in the Food Code and shows that the disease or\nsymptom makes the conditional employee an individual with an ADA disability, the\nemployer may withdraw the job offer only if:\n\u2022\t The job involves food handling; and\n\u2022\t The employer determines that either there is no reasonable\naccommodation that would eliminate the risk of transmitting the disease\nthrough food, or any such accommodation would be an undue hardship to\nthe business.\n\u2022\t There is no need to offer the conditional employee a vacant position not\ninvolving food handling as a reasonable accommodation.\nIt should be noted that the information provided here about the ADA is intended to alert\nemployers to the existence of ADA and related CFR requirements.

Once\nnotified, the person in charge can take action to prevent the likelihood of the\ntransmission of foodborne illness.

The CDC published on its website in November 2012 a list of Pathogens\nTransmitted by Food Contaminated by Infected Persons Who Handle Food, and Modes\nof Transmission of Such Pathogens. See the list at http://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/foodsafety-office.html#food\nThe final list has been reviewed in light of new information and has been revised as set\nforth below.\nPathogens Transmitted by Food Contaminated by Infected Persons Who Handle\nFood, and Modes of Transmission of Such Pathogens\nSome pathogens are frequently transmitted by food contaminated by infected persons.\nThe presence of any one of the following signs or symptoms in persons who handle\nfood may indicate infection by a pathogen that could be transmitted to others through\nhandling the food supply: diarrhea, vomiting, open skin sores, boils, fever, dark urine or\njaundice. The failure of food-handlers to wash hands in certain situations (such as after\nusing the toilet, handling raw meat, cleaning spills, or carrying garbage), wear clean\ngloves, or use clean utensils is responsible for the foodborne transmission of these\npathogens. Non-foodborne routes of transmission, such as from one person to another,\nare also major contributors in the spread of these pathogens.\nSome pathogens usually cause disease when food is intrinsically contaminated or\ncross-contaminated during production, processing or transportation, but may also be\ncontaminated when prepared by infected persons. Bacterial pathogens in this category\noften cause disease after bacteria have multiplied in food after it has been kept at\nimproper temperatures permitting their multiplication to an infectious dose. Preventing\nfood contact by persons who have an acute diarrheal illness will decrease the risk of\ntransmitting these pathogens.\nThe following represent both types of pathogens that may be transmitted by an infected\nfood handler:\nAstroviruses\nBacillus cereus\nCampylobacter jejuni\nClostridium perfringens\nCryptosporidium species\nEntamoeba histolytica\nEnterohemorrhagic E. coli\nEnterotoxigenic E. coli\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nGiardia intestinalis\nHepatitis A virus\nNontyphoidal Salmonella\nNoroviruses\nRotaviruses\nSalmonella Typhi*\nSapoviruses\nShigella species\nStaphylococcus aureus\nStreptococcus pyogenes\nTaenia solium - cysticercosis\nVibrio cholera\nYersinia enterocolitica\n* 1. Kauffmann-White scheme for designation of Salmonella serotypes\nThe 6 Listed Pathogens:\nThe CDC has designated the 6 organisms listed in the Food Code as having high\ninfectivity via contamination of food by infected food employees. This designation is\nbased on the number of confirmed cases reported that involved food employees\ninfected with one of these organisms and/ or the severity of the medical consequences\nto those who become ill.\nThe following is taken from information provided in the 19th Edition of Control of\nCommunicable Diseases Manual, the CDC website, and the FDA Bad Bug Book, 2nd\nEdition, and is provided as background information on pathogen virulence, infectivity,\nand common symptoms exhibited with infection of each of the 6 listed pathogens.\nNOROVIRUS\nNoroviruses (genus Norovirus, family Caliciviridae) are small (27-40 nm), round\nstructured, single-stranded RNA, nonenveloped viruses. They are a genetically diverse\ngroup classified into at least five genogroups, designated GI-GV, which are further subdivided into at least 35 genotypes. Noroviruses are recognized as the most common\ncause of epidemic and sporadic gastroenteritis across all age groups worldwide.\nTransmission of norovirus occurs primarily through the fecal-oral route, including direct\nperson-to-person contact and indirect transmission through contaminated food, water,\nor environmental surfaces. Vomitus-oral transmission can also occur through\naerosolization followed by direct ingestion or environmental contamination.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nNoroviruses are the leading cause of foodborne illness in the United States. Food\nhandler contact with raw or other ready-to-eat foods is the most common scenario\nresulting in foodborne norovirus outbreaks. Norovirus contamination of produce and\nshellfish can also occur during production. Secondary household transmission is\ncommon.\nNoroviruses are environmentally stable, able to survive both freezing and heating\n(although not thorough cooking), are resistant to many common chemical disinfectants,\nand can persist on surfaces for up to 2 weeks. Proper hand hygiene and exclusion of\nfood employees exhibiting symptoms of norovirus disease (i.e., diarrhea or vomiting)\nare critical for norovirus control.\nIncubation Period: In volunteer studies, the range is 10-50 hours. In foodborne\nnorovirus outbreaks, the median incubation period is 33 hours.\nSymptoms and Complications: Acute-onset of vomiting, watery non-bloody diarrhea,\nabdominal cramps, and nausea, or a combination of these symptoms. Low grade fever\nand body aches may also be associated. Symptoms typically last 24 to 72 hours.\nNorovirus disease is usually self-limited without any serious long-term sequelae.\nAmong the young and the elderly, dehydration is a common complication. Volunteer\nstudies have found that as many as 30% of individuals infected with norovirus are\nasymptomatic. There is no specific treatment for norovirus disease. Supportive\ntherapy consists of oral or intravenous rehydration solutions to replace fluid loss and\nelectrolytes. Previous exposure does not provide long-term immunity; thus, individuals\nmay be repeatedly infected throughout their lifetimes.\nInfectivity: Noroviruses are highly contagious, and it is thought that an inoculum of as\nfew as 18 viral particles may be sufficient to infect an individual. Although presymptomatic shedding may occur, shedding usually begins with onset of symptoms,\npeaks 4 days after exposure, and may persist for 3 weeks after recovery. However the\ndegree of infectivity of prolonged shedding has not been determined and peak\ncontagiousness is during the acute stage of disease. Peak viral loads in both\nsymptomatic and asymptomatic infections (may be as high as 100 billion viral\nparticles/g feces).\nNONTYPHOIdahoAL SALMONELLA\nCaused by serotypes other than S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A.\nUnlike previous editions of the FDA Food Code, the 2013 edition requires food\nemployees to report a diagnosis of nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS), prompts the person\nin charge to exclude food employees with diagnosis of NTS, and provides conditions for\nreinstatement of a food employee who provides to the person in charge written medical\ndocumentation from a health practitioner that states the food employee is free from\nNTS, and where appropriate, approval from the regulatory authority\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines",

NTS are estimated to cause more than one million\ndomestically acquired foodborne illnesses in the United States each year (Scallan et. al.\n2011), and are the leading cause of hospitalizations and deaths due to foodborne\nillness in the United States (Barton-Behravesh et al. 2011, CDC 2011). Whereas\nreductions in incidence have been achieved for many other foodborne pathogens in\nrecent years, no significant change in incidence of NTS infections has occurred since\nthe start of FoodNet surveillance during 1996\u20131998 (CDC 2011). Therefore, further\ninterventions are needed to reduce the incidence of NTS infections.\nCommercial food establishments are an important setting for the transmission of NTS,\nboth in the form of recognized foodborne disease outbreaks as well as sporadic\ninfections. During 1998 to 2002, the 585 Salmonella enterica outbreaks reported to the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention accounted for 49% of all bacterial\noutbreaks (Lynch et al. 2006). Forty-six percent of Salmonella outbreaks occurred in\nrestaurant/deli establishments, the most common setting for Salmonella outbreaks\n(Lynch et al. 2006). For the period of 2009-2010, the 243 Salmonella outbreaks\nreported to the CDC accounted for 51% of bacterial foodborne disease outbreaks.\nOutbreaks of salmonellosis at commercial food establishments frequently involve direct\ntransmission to patrons from fresh produce or undercooked foods of animal origin, or\ncross contamination from these foods. However, numerous NTS outbreak\ninvestigations have implicated food workers as the source of the outbreak or strongly\nsuggested transmission from food workers (Ethelberg et al. 2004; Greig et al. 2007;\nHedberg et. al. 1991; Hedican et al. 2009; Hundy and Cameron 2002; Khuri-Bulos et al.\n1994; Maguire et al. 2000; Medus et al. 2006; Todd et al 2007a, 2007b).\nIn a study of restaurant-associated salmonellosis outbreaks in Minnesota published by\nMedus et al. (2006), the importance of infected food workers as a source of\ncontamination in the outbreaks was supported by several observations. First, a specific\nfood vehicle was statistically implicated or suspected in a low proportion of the\nrestaurant outbreaks (39%), which suggests that the specific food items or food\nhandling errors were not the primary causes for these outbreaks. Second, food workers\ninfected with NTS were identified in the majority (83%) of the outbreak investigations.\nInfected food workers who reported a history of illness shed NTS in the stool for a\nmedian of 1 month. The authors concluded that regardless of the original source of a\nSalmonella outbreak in a restaurant (e.g., raw meat or eggs), the initial source of a\nsalmonellosis outbreak, food workers frequently serve as reservoirs for NTS and\ncontribute to transmission to patrons. Thus, assessment of food worker history, i.e.,\nsymptoms and exposures, testing of stool samples and exclusion or restriction of\ninfected food workers from the food establishment are essential for controlling\nrestaurant-associated outbreaks of salmonellosis.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nIn a study of food workers with salmonellosis who were detected through routine\nsurveillance (Medus et al. 2010), 2.2% of identified culture-confirmed Salmonella cases\nwere food workers, and identification of these cases were critical to the identification of\nnumerous outbreaks. The authors concluded that the rapid identification and follow-up\nof food workers among reported cases of salmonellosis is important to the early\ndetection and control of outbreaks in restaurant settings. Importantly, even hostesses,\nservers, bartenders, and others who theoretically have limited food preparation duties\ncan serve as sentinels of transmission within the restaurant. The authors also stated\nthat food workers should be considered an important source of Salmonella\ntransmission, and those identified through surveillance should raise a high index of\nsuspicion of a possible outbreak at their place of work. Food service managers need to\nbe alert to Salmonella-like illnesses among food workers to facilitate prevention and\ncontrol efforts, including exclusion of infected food workers or restriction of their duties.\nThe biology of NTS and the epidemiology of salmonellosis are complex; food workers\nmay be an underappreciated part of that complexity. In order to decrease the incidence\nof NTS infections in the United States, commercial food establishments should also be\ntargets for more focused prevention measures, and prevention and control efforts\nshould consider food workers as an important source of NTS transmission.\nGeneral Description:\nNontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) enterica are bacteria that cause a diarrheal illness\ncalled salmonellosis. NTS are among the most common and important causes of\nenteric disease. An estimated 1.2 million cases occur annually in the United States; of\nthese, approximately 42,000 are culture-confirmed cases reported to the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention.\nSalmonella lives in the intestines of animals or humans. It can be found in water, food,\nsoil, or surfaces that have been contaminated with the feces of infected animals or\nhumans. People can become infected with Salmonella by:\n\u2022\t Eating foods contaminated with the bacteria. Contaminated foods are often of\nanimal origin, such as beef, poultry, unpasteurized milk, or eggs. Fruits and\nvegetables may also be contaminated. Any food can be contaminated by an\ninfected food handler.\n\u2022\t Contacting farm animals or pets (including reptiles, amphibians, chicks, and\nducklings), animal feces, or animal environments.\n\u2022\t Touching contaminated surfaces or objects and then touching ones mouth or\nputting a contaminated object into ones mouth.\n\u2022\t Drinking contaminated water.\nMost infections are thought to be acquired through consumption of contaminated food.\nIncubation Period:\nSymptoms often begin 12 to 72 hours after being exposed to the bacteria, although it\ncan take up to a week or more for symptoms to develop in some people.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines",

    "content": "Annex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nSymptoms and Complications:\nSymptoms of salmonellosis include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever. The illness\nusually lasts 4 to 7 days. Persons with NTS infections usually recover without\ntreatment. However, in approximately 20% of persons, the illness is so severe that\nhospitalization is required. In these patients the NTS infection may spread from the\nintestine to the blood stream, and then to other body sites and can cause death unless\nthe person is treated promptly with antibiotics. An estimated 400 fatal cases of\nsalmonellosis occur each year. A small number of persons experience long-term\nconsequences from NTS infections, such as arthritis that can last for months or years.\nAntibiotic treatment for salmonellosis is generally not indicated for typical intestinal\nillness. Antibiotics typically do not shorten the duration of illness or eliminate the carrier\nstate. However, antibiotic treatment is recommended for persons who develop invasive\n(extraintestinal) infections, infants under 2 months of age, the elderly, or those who\nhave certain underlying medical conditions that predispose them to invasive infection.\nInfectivity:\nThe minimum infectious dose of NTS for humans is generally described as 100 to\n1,000 organisms. However, doses of fewer than 10 organisms have caused illness in\nmultiple outbreaks. Persistence of NTS in the stool after the acute phase of illness is a\nwell described consequence of NTS infections. This persistence is often referred to as\na temporary carrier state, and the term \u201cshedding\u201d is used to describe the excretion of\nSalmonella in the stool.\nStudies have consistently shown that the median duration of shedding in the stool to be\n4 to 5 weeks after onset of acute gastroenteritis. Persons who have been exposed to\nNTS but who never develop symptoms can also be temporary carriers of NTS; these\npersons shed NTS for a shorter period of time than persons who experienced illness.\nCarriers of NTS are known to shed the bacteria in the stool intermittently. Treatment\nwith antimicrobials does not eradicate NTS from stool and may actually prolong the\nduration of shedding.\nSALMONELLA TYPHI\nSalmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi (commonly S. Typhi) causes a\nsystemic bacterial disease, with humans as the only host. This disease is relatively rare\nin the United States, with fewer than 500 sporadic cases occurring annually in the U.S.\nWorldwide, the annual estimated incidence of typhoid fever is about 17 million cases\nwith approximately 600,000 deaths. Currently, most cases of S. Typhi in industrialized\nnations are imported into the country from developing countries. Antibiotic-resistant\nstrains have become prevalent in several areas of the world.\nIncubation period: Generally 1 to 3 weeks, but may be as long as 2 months after\nexposure.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nSymptoms and Complications: High fever, from 103\u00b0 to 104\u00b0F; lethargy;\ngastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pains and diarrhea or constipation;\nheadache; achiness; loss of appetite. A rash of flat, rose-colored spots sometimes\noccurs. Septicemia, with colonization of other tissues and organs; e.g., may lead to\nendocarditis. Septic arthritis may occur, in which the infection directly affects the joints\nand may be difficult to treat. Chronic infection of the gallbladder may occur, which may\ncause the infected person to become a carrier.\nInfectivity: The minimal infectious dose is estimated to be less than 1000 bacterial\ncells. An individual infected with S. Typhi is infectious as long as the bacilli appear in\nthe excreta, usually from the first week throughout the convalescence; variable\nthereafter. About 10% of untreated typhoid fever patients will discharge bacilli for\n3 months after onset of symptoms, and 2%-5% become permanent carriers.\nSHIGA TOXIN-PRODUCING ESCHERICHIA COLI\nE. coli O157:H7 is the most commonly identified serotype of Shiga toxin-producing\nEscherichia coli (STEC) as a cause of foodborne illness in the United States. E. coli\nO157:H7 is a zoonotic disease derived from cattle and other ruminants. However, E.\ncoli O157:H7 also readily transmits from person-to-person, so contaminated raw\ningredients and ill food employees both can be sources of foodborne disease. Other\nSTEC serotypes have been identified as a source of foodborne illness in the United\nStates, however not as frequently as E. coli O157:H7. The other serogroups most\ncommonly implicated as a cause of foodborne illness in the United States are O26,\nO111, O103, O45, and O121.\nThe Food Code definition of STEC covers all E. coli identified in clinical laboratories\nthat produce Shiga toxins. Nearly 200 O:H combinations of E. coli have been shown to\nproduce Shiga toxins. The Food Code definition includes all STEC, including those that\nhave not been specifically implicated in human disease such as hemorrhagic colitis\n(i.e., bloody diarrhea) or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Infections with STEC may\nbe asymptomatic but are classically associated with bloody diarrhea (hemorrhagic\ncolitis) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura\n(TTP). [Note: \u201centerohemorrhagic\u201d (EHEC) is a subset of STEC that has the capacity\nto both produce Shiga toxin and cause \u201cattaching and effacing\u201d lesions in the intestine.]\nIncubation period: Symptoms usually begin 3 to 4 days after exposure, but the time\nmay range from 1 to 9 days.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines",

In some cases, the diarrhea may be extreme, appearing to\nconsist entirely of blood and occurring every 15 to 30 minutes. Fever typically is lowgrade or absent. Infections from EHEC may range from asymptomatic to mild diarrhea\nto severe, life threatening complications (e.g., hemorrhagic colitis, hemolytic uremic\nsyndrome)). About 3% to 7% STEC infections progress to HUS .\nInfectivity: The infective dose of E. coli O157:H7 is estimated to be very low, in the\nrange of 10 to 100 cells. Children under 5 years old are most frequently diagnosed with\ninfection and are at greatest risk of developing HUS. The elderly also experience a\ngreater risk of complications. The duration of excretion of STEC in the stool is typically\n1 week or less in adults, but can be up to 3 weeks or longer in one-third of infected\nchildren.\nSHIGELLA SPP.\nCauses an acute bacterial disease, known as shigellosis, and primarily occurs in\nhumans, but also occurs in other primates such as monkeys and chimpanzees. An\nestimated 300,000 cases of shigellosis occur annually in the U.S. Shigella spp. consist\nof 4 species or serogroups, including S. flexneri, S. boydii, S. sonnei, and\nS. dysenteriae; which all differ in geographical distribution and pathogenicity. Shigella\nspp. are highly infectious and highly virulent. Outbreaks occur in overcrowding\nconditions, where personal hygiene is poor, including in institutions, such as prisons,\nmental hospitals, day care centers, and refugee camps, and also among men who have\nsex with men. Water and RTE foods contaminated by feces, frequently from food\nemployees\u2019 hands, are common causes of disease transmission. Multidrug-resistant\nShigella (including S. dysenteriae type 1) have appeared worldwide. Concern over\nincreasing antimicrobial resistance has led to reduced use of antimicrobial therapy in\ntreating shigellosis.\nIncubation period: Eight to 50 hours.\nSymptoms and Complications: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, nausea, and\nsometimes vomiting, tenesmus, toxaemia, and cramps. The stools typically contain\nblood, pus, or mucus resulting from mucosal ulcerations. The illness is usually selflimited, with an average duration of 5-7 days. Infections are also associated with rectal\nbleeding, drastic dehydration, and convulsions in young children. The fatality rate for\nShigella dysenteriae 1 may be as high as 20% among hospitalized cases. Other\ncomplications can also occur, such as reactive arthritis, intestinal perforation, and\nhemolytic uremic syndrome.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nInfectivity: The infectious dose for humans is low, with as few as 10 bacterial cells\ndepending on age and condition of the host. Infectivity occurs during acute infection\nand until the infectious agent is no longer present in feces, usually within 4 weeks after\nillness. Asymptomatic carriers may transmit infection; rarely, the carrier state may\npersist for months or longer.\nHEPATITIS A VIRUS\nHepatitis A virus (HAV) is a 27-nanometer picornavirus (positive strand RNA, nonenveloped virus). The hepatitis A virus has been classified as a member of the family\nPicornaviridae. The exact pathogenesis of HAV infection is not understood, but the\nvirus appears to invade from the intestinal tract and is subsequently transported to the\nliver. The hepatocytes are the site of viral replication and the virus is thought to be\nshed via the bile.\nHAV is most commonly spread by the fecal-oral route through person-to-person\ncontact. Risk factors for reported cases of hepatitis A include personal or sexual\ncontact with another case, illegal drug use, homosexual male sex contact, and travel to\nan endemic country. Common source outbreaks also can occur through ingestion of\nwater or food that has fecal contamination. However, the source of infection is not\nidentified for approximately 50% of reported cases.\nHAV infection is endemic in developing countries, and less common in industrialized\ncountries with good environmental sanitation and hygienic practices. In the developing\nworld, nearly all HAV infections occur in childhood and are asymptomatic or cause a\nmild illness. As a result, hepatitis A (symptomatic infection with jaundice) is rarely seen\nin the developing world. More than 90% of adults born in many developing countries\nare seropositive.\nChildren play an important role in the transmission of HAV and serve as a source of\ninfection for others, because most children have asymptomatic infections or mild,\nunrecognized HAV infections. In the United States, the disease is most common\namong school-aged children and young adults. After correction for under-reporting and\nundiagnosed infections, an estimated 61,000 HAV infections (includes cases of\nhepatitis A as well as asymptomatic infections) occurred in 2003.\nHAV Immunization: Immune globulin (IG) can be used to provide passive preexposure immunoprophylaxis against hepatitis A. Protection is immediately conferred\nto an exposed individual following administration of IG, and immunity is provided for 3-5\nmonths following inoculation. IG is effective in preventing HAV infection when given as\npost-exposure immunoprophylaxis, if given within 14 days of exposure. When a food\nemployee with hepatitis A is identified, IG is often given to co-workers. Active\nimmunoprophylaxis using hepatitis A vaccine (a formalin-inactivated, attenuated strain\nof HAV) has been shown to provide immunity in > 95% of those immunized, with\nminimal adverse reactions.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines",

    "content": "Annex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nHepatitis A vaccination of food employee has been advocated, but has not been shown\nto be cost-effective and generally is not recommended in the United States, although it\nmay be appropriate in some communities.\nIncubation period: Average 28-30 days (range 15-50 days).\nSymptoms and Complications: Illness usually begins with symptoms such as nausea/\nvomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, headache, and/or fatigue. Jaundice, dark\nurine or light colored stools might be present at onset, or follow illness symptoms within\na few days. HAV infection of older children and adults is more likely to cause clinical\nillness with jaundice (i.e., hepatitis A); onset of illness is usually abrupt. In young\nadults, 76-97% have symptoms and 40-70% are jaundiced. Jaundice generally occurs\n5-7 days after the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms. For asymptomatic infections,\nevidence of hepatitis may be detectable only through laboratory tests of liver infections\nsuch as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) tests. The disease varies in severity from a\nmild illness to a fulminant hepatitis, ranging from 1-2 weeks to several months in\nduration. In up to 10-15% of the reported cases, prolonged, relapsing hepatitis for up to\n6 months occurs. The degree of severity often increases with age; however, most\ncases result in complete recovery, without sequelae or recurrence. The reported case\nfatality rate is 0.1% - 0.3% and can reach 1.8% for adults over 50 years old.\nDiagnosis: Diagnosis of HAV infection requires specific serological testing for IgM antiHAV. IgM anti-HAV becomes undetectable within 6 months of illness onset for most\npersons; however, some persons can remain IgM anti-HAV positive for years after acute\ninfection. Total anti-HAV (the only other licensed serologic test) can be detected during\nacute infection but remains positive after recovery and for the remainder of the person\u2019s\nlife.\nInfectivity: The infective dose of HAV is presumed to be low (10 to 100 viral particles),\nalthough the exact dose is unknown. The viral particles are excreted in the feces of ill\npeople (symptomatic and asymptomatic) at high densities (106 to 108\n/gm) and have\nbeen demonstrated to be excreted at these levels for up to 36 days post-infection.\nEvidence indicates maximum infectivity during the latter half of the incubation period,\ncontinuing for a few days after onset of jaundice. Most cases are probably\nnoninfectious after the first week of jaundice. Chronic shedding of HAV in feces has not\nbeen reported. HAV is shed at peak levels in the feces, one to two weeks before onset\nof symptoms, and shedding diminishes rapidly after liver dysfunction or symptoms\nappear. Liver dysfunction or symptoms occur at the same time circulating antibodies to\nHAV first appear. Immunity after infection probably lasts for life; immunity after\nvaccination is estimated to last for at least 20 years.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nReporting History of Exposure:\nThe reporting requirements for history of exposure are designed to identify employees\nwho may be incubating an infection due to norovirus, Shigella spp., E. coli O157:H7 or\nother STEC, typhoid fever, HAV.\nWhich employees who report exposure are restricted?\n\u2022\t Employees who work in a food establishment serving a highly susceptible\npopulation (HSP) facility, except those employees who are exposed to\nnontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS).\n\nWhy don\u2019t employees who are exposed to nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) need to be\nrestricted?\n\u2022\t For those employees who are exposed to nontyphoidal Salmonella, exposure\nalone does not necessitate restriction of the employee based on epidemiologic\nevidence of no increased risk of employees with only a history of exposure\nversus employees who were infected and diagnosed.\nWhat constitutes exposure?\n\u2022\t Consuming a food that caused illness in another consumer due to infection with\nNorovirus, Shigella spp., E. coli O157:H7 or other STEC, typhoid fever, or\nHAV.\n\u2022\t Attending an event or working in a setting where there is a known disease\noutbreak.\n\n\u2022\t Close contact with a household member who is ill and is diagnosed with a listed\npathogen.\nWhy are other guidelines provided, in addition to restriction for employees serving an\nHSP who report exposure to hepatitis A virus?\n\u2022\t Employees who have had a hepatitis A illness in the past are most likely\n\nprotected from infection by life-time immunity to hepatitis A infection.\n\n\u2022\t Immunity developed through immunization or IgG inoculation prevents hepatitis\nA infection in exposed employees.\n\u2022\t Our standard definition of HSP doesn\u2019t apply very well to HAV. Children under\n6 years old who become infected with HAV are generally asymptomatic, and\nwhile a higher proportion of susceptible elderly who become infected have\nserious illness, most institutionalized elderly are protected from HAV by prior\ninfection.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nWhat is the period of restriction?\n\u2022\t The period of restriction begins with the most recent time of foodborne or\nhousehold member exposure and lasts for the usual incubation period of the\npathogen as defined in the Control of Communicable Diseases Manual.

    "content": "2-201.12 Exclusions and Restrictions.2\nRefer to public health reasons for \u00a7 2-201.11 for actions to take with conditional\nemployees.\nIt is necessary to exclude food employees symptomatic with diarrhea, vomiting, or\njaundice, or suffering from a disease likely to be transmitted through contamination of\nfood, because of the increased risk that the food being prepared will be contaminated\nsuch as with a pathogenic microorganism. However, if the food employee is suffering\nfrom vomiting or diarrhea symptoms, and the condition is from a non-infectious\ncondition, Crohn\u2019s disease or an illness during early stages of a pregnancy, the risk of\ntransmitting a pathogenic microorganism is minimal. In this case, the food employee\nmay remain working in a full capacity if they can substantiate that the symptom is from\na noninfectious condition. The food employee can substantiate this through providing\nto the person in charge medical documentation or other documentation proving that the\nsymptom is from a noninfectious condition.\nBecause of the high infectivity (ability to invade and multiply) and/ or virulence (ability to\nproduce severe disease), of typhoid fever (Salmonella Typhi) and hepatitis A virus, a\nfood employee diagnosed with an active case of illness caused by either of these two\npathogens, whether asymptomatic or symptomatic, must be excluded from food\nestablishments. The exclusion is based on the high infectivity, and/or the severe\nmedical consequences to individuals infected with these organisms. A food employee\ndiagnosed with an active case of illness caused by norovirus, Shigella spp., STEC, or\nnontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS), is excluded if exhibiting symptoms of vomiting and\ndiarrhea, and then allowed to work as the level of risk of pathogen transmission\ndecreases (See section 2-201.12, Tables #1b, #2 and #3).\nThe degree of risk for a food employee or conditional employee who is diagnosed with\nan infection but asymptomatic with regard to symptoms, to transmit a foodborne\npathogen decreases with the resolution of symptoms. This risk decreases even further\nfor those employees that are diagnosed with a listed pathogen, but never developed\nsymptoms. The decrease in risk is taken under consideration when excluding and\nrestricting diagnosed food employees and results in a slight difference in the way food\nemployees diagnosed with Norovirus, but asymptomatic with respect to gastrointestinal\nsymptoms are handled (See section 2-201.12, Table #2).\nIn order to comply with Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, an exclusion must also be removed if the\nemployee is entitled to a reasonable accommodation that would eliminate the risk of transmitting the disease.\nReasonable accommodation may include reassignment to another position in which the individual would not work\naround food. The steps an employer must take when an excluded employee requests reasonable accommodation\nare briefly described in Annex 3, \u00a7 2-201.\n\n11. However, it is not possible to explain all relevant aspects of the ADA\nwithin this Annex. When faced with an apparent conflict between ADA and the Food Code\u2019s exclusion and restriction\nrequirements, employers should contact the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nRestriction of food employees infected with NTS after resolution of symptoms has not\nbeen a national standard. However, because of the prolonged duration of shedding of\nNTS, evidence that food workers have been the source of foodborne outbreaks,\nevidence that food workers work while ill (Green et al. 2005), and evidence of\ninadequate hand hygiene practices (Green et al. 2006; US FDA 2004), exclusion or\nrestriction of infected food worker duties is a reasonable public health measure. At a\nminimum, potential for transmission and how to prevent it should be discussed with the\nfood employee and their manager.\nThere is no epidemiological evidence of an increased risk of NTS transmission from\nfood employees in highly susceptible populations over the general population. Current\nevidence suggests that restriction is sufficient in food establishments that serve either\nhighly susceptible populations or the non-highly susceptible populations to control\ntransmission on NTS. Further, events where an infected food handler is involved in\nnontyphoidal salmonellosis outbreaks in establishments serving highly susceptible\npopulations are much less frequent than those in establishments not serving highly\nsusceptible populations. For example, from 1998-2011, only 41 nontyphoidal\nsalmonellosis outbreaks were reported to CDC that occurred in SNF facilities\nand 16 outbreaks in hospitals, compared with 731 outbreaks in restaurants or delis.\nThere are many highly susceptible persons in the general population who eat in regular,\nnon-institutionalized settings. A more restrictive exclusion criteria for establishments\nserving highly susceptible populations is not warranted at this time.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n2-201.11 / 2-201.12 Decision Tree 1.

    "content": "2-201.12 Exclusion and Restrictions (continued)3\nRestrictions and exclusions vary according to the population served because highly\nsusceptible populations have increased vulnerability to foodborne illness. For example,\nfoodborne illness in a healthy individual may be manifested by mild flu-like symptoms.\nThe same foodborne illness may have serious medical consequences in\nimmunocompromised individuals. This point is reinforced by statistics pertaining to\ndeaths associated with foodborne illness caused by Salmonella Enteritidis. Over 70%\nof the deaths in outbreaks attributed to this organism occurred among individuals who\nfor one reason or another were immunocompromised. This is why the restrictions and\nexclusions listed in the Code are especially stringent for food employees serving highly\nsusceptible populations.\nPeriodic testing of food employees for the presence of diseases transmissible through\nfood is not cost effective or reliable. Therefore, restriction and exclusion provisions are\ntriggered by the active gastrointestinal symptoms, followed by diagnosis and history of\nexposure.\nThe history of exposure that must be reported applies to Norovirus, Hepatitis A, Shigella\nspp., STEC and Salmonella Typhi. It does not include nontyphoidal Salmonella.\nUpon being notified of the history of exposure, the person in charge should\nimmediately:\n\n1. Discuss the traditional modes of transmission of fecal-oral route pathogens.\n\n2. Advise the food employee to observe good hygienic practices both at home and at\nwork. This includes a discussion of proper handwashing, as described in the Code,\nafter going to the bathroom, changing diapers, or handling stool-soiled material.\n\n3. Review the symptoms listed in the Code that require immediate exclusion from the\nfood establishment.\n\n4. Remind food employees of their responsibility as specified in the Code to inform the\nperson in charge immediately upon the onset of any of the symptoms listed in the\nCode.\n\n5. Ensure that the food employee stops work immediately if any of the symptoms\ndescribed in the Code develop and reports to the person in charge.\nIn order to comply with Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, an exclusion must also be removed if the\nemployee is entitled to a reasonable accommodation that would eliminate the risk of transmitting the disease.\nReasonable accommodation may include reassignment to another position in which the individual would not work\naround food. The steps an employer must take when an excluded employee requests reasonable accommodation\nare briefly described in Annex 3, \u00a7 2-201.\n\n11. However, it is not possible to explain all relevant aspects of the ADA\nwithin this Annex. When faced with an apparent conflict between the ADA and the Food Code\u2019s exclusion and\nrestriction requirements, employers should contact the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\n\nA restricted food employee may work in an area of the food establishment that houses\npackaged food, wrapped single-service or single-use articles, or soiled food equipment\nor utensils. Examples of activities that a restricted person might do include working at\nthe cash register, seating patrons, bussing tables, stocking canned or other packaged\nfoods, or working in a non-food cleaning or maintenance capacity consistent with the\ncriteria in the definition of the term \u201crestricted.\u201d A food employee who is restricted from\nworking in one food establishment may not work in an unrestricted capacity in another\nfood establishment, but could work unrestricted in another retail store that is not a food\nestablishment. A restricted food employee may enter a food establishment as a\nconsumer.\nAn excluded individual may not work as a food employee on the premises of any food\nestablishment.",

However these symptomatic, diagnosed food employees differ from\nsymptomatic, undiagnosed food employees in the requirements that must be met\nbefore returning to work in a full capacity after symptoms resolve.\nThe person in charge may allow undiagnosed food employees who are initially\nsymptomatic and whose symptoms have resolved to return to work in a full capacity\n24 hours after symptoms resolve.\nHowever, diagnosis with a listed pathogen invokes additional requirements before the\nperson in charge may allow diagnosed food employees to return to work in full capacity.\nAsymptomatic food employees diagnosed with Norovirus, Shigella spp., E. coli\nO157:H7 or other STEC may not return to work in a full capacity for at least 24 hours\nafter symptoms resolve. The person in charge shall only allow these food employees to\nwork on a restricted basis 24 hours after symptoms resolve and they shall only allow\nthis if not in a food establishment that serves a highly susceptible population. These\nrestricted food employees remain restricted until they are medically cleared or\notherwise meet the criteria for removal from restriction as specified under\nsubparagraphs 2-201.13(D) (1)-(2); 2-201.13(E)(1)-(2); or 2-201.13(F)(1)-(2).\nIn order to comply with Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, an exclusion must also be removed if the\nemployee is entitled to a reasonable accommodation that would eliminate the risk of transmitting the disease.\nReasonable accommodation may include reassignment to another position in which the individual would not work\naround food. The steps an employer must take when an excluded employee requests reasonable accommodation\nare briefly described in Annex 3, \u00a7 2-201.\n\n11. However, it is not possible to explain all relevant aspects of the ADA\nwithin this Annex. When faced with an apparent conflict between the ADA and the Food Code\u2019s exclusion and\nrestriction requirements, employers should contact the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nIn a food establishment that serves a highly susceptible population, food employees\nwho are diagnosed with Norovirus, Shigella spp., E. coli O157:H7 or other STEC and\ninitially symptomatic with vomiting or diarrhea, shall not work on a restricted basis after\nbeing asymptomatic for at least 24 hours. These food employees must remain\nexcluded until they are medically cleared or otherwise meet the criteria for removal from\nexclusion from a highly susceptible population under subparagraph 2-201.13(D)(1)-(2),\n2-201.13(E)(1)-(2), or 2-201.13 (F)(1)-(2).\nFood employees diagnosed with hepatitis A virus are always excluded if diagnosed\nwithin 14 days of exhibiting any illness symptom, until at least 7 days after the onset of\njaundice, or until medically cleared as specified under subparagraphs\n2-201.13(B)(1)-(4).\nFood employees diagnosed with hepatitis A virus are always excluded if diagnosed\nwithin 14 days of exhibiting any illness symptom, until at least 7 days after the onset of\njaundice, or until medically cleared as specified under subparagraphs\n2-201.13(B)(1)-(3). A food employee with an anicteric infection with the hepatitis A virus\nhas a mild form of hepatitis A without jaundice. Food employees diagnosed with an\nanicteric infection with the hepatitis A virus are excluded if they are within 14 days of\nany symptoms. Anicteric, diagnosed food employees shall be removed from exclusion\nif more than 14 days have passed since they became symptomatic, or if medically\ncleared. Asymptomatic food employees diagnosed with an active infection with the\nhepatitis A virus are also excluded until medically cleared.\nFood employees diagnosed with typhoid fever (caused by a Salmonella Typhi\ninfection) are always excluded, even without expressing gastrointestinal symptoms,\nsince these symptoms are not typically exhibited with typhoid fever. Outbreaks of\nfoodborne illness involving typhoid fever (Salmonella Typhi) have been traced to\nasymptomatic food employees who have transmitted the pathogen to food, causing\nillness. The high virulence combined with the extremely high infectivity of S. Typhi\nwarrant exclusion from the food establishment until the food employee has been\ncleared by a physician or has completed antibiotic therapy.\nAsymptomatic shedders are food employees who do not exhibit the symptoms of\nfoodborne illness but who are identified through diagnosis, or laboratory confirmation of\ntheir stools to have Norovirus, or any one of the four bacterial pathogens identified in\nChapter 2 in their gastrointestinal system.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nThe risk that food employees who are asymptomatic shedders will transmit a\ncommunicable disease varies depending upon the hygienic habits of the worker, the\nfood itself and how it is prepared, the susceptibility of the population served, and the\ninfectivity of the organism. Exclusion in a food establishment that serves a highly\nsusceptible population affords protection to people who are immune-suppressed.\nRestriction in a food establishment that does not serve a highly susceptible population\naffords protection for the general population and the immune-suppressed subset of the\ngeneral population provided there is adequate attention to personal hygiene and\navoidance of bare-hand contact with RTE foods.\nTo minimize the risk in all food establishments of the transmission of foodborne disease\nby an asymptomatic shedder and based on the factors listed above, all known\nasymptomatic shedders of the four bacterial pathogens are either restricted or\nexcluded, depending on the population served. Requiring restriction for asymptomatic\nshedders of all three of the bacterial pathogens results in a uniform criterion and is\nconsistent with APHA-published recommendations in the \"Control of Communicable\nDiseases Manual.\"\nHands and Arms 2-301.11 Clean Condition.\nThe hands are particularly important in transmitting foodborne pathogens. Food\nemployees with dirty hands and/or fingernails may contaminate the food being\nprepared. Therefore, any activity which may contaminate the hands must be followed\nby thorough handwashing in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Code.\nEven seemingly healthy employees may serve as reservoirs for pathogenic\nmicroorganisms that are transmissible through food. Staphylococci, for example, can\nbe found on the skin and in the mouth, throat, and nose of many employees. The\nhands of employees can be contaminated by touching their nose or other body parts.",

    "content": "2-301.12 Cleaning Procedure.\nHandwashing is a critical factor in reducing fecal-oral pathogens that can be transmitted\nfrom hands to RTE food as well as other pathogens that can be transmitted from\nenvironmental sources. Many employees fail to wash their hands as often as\nnecessary and even those who do may use flawed techniques.\nIn the case of a food worker with one hand or a hand-like prosthesis, the Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission has agreed that this requirement for thorough\nhandwashing can be met through reasonable accommodation in accordance with the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act. Devices are available which can be attached to a\nlavatory to enable the food worker with one hand to adequately generate the necessary\nfriction to achieve the intent of this requirement.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\n\nThe greatest concentration of microbes exists around and under the fingernails of the\nhands. The area under the fingernails, known as the \u201csubungal space\u201d, has by far the\nlargest concentration of microbes on the hand and this is also the most difficult area of\nthe hand to decontaminate. Fingernail brushes, if used properly, have been found to be\neffective tools in decontaminating this area of the hand. Proper use of single-use\nfingernail brushes, or designated individual fingernail brushes for each employee,\nduring the handwashing procedure can achieve up to a 5-log reduction in\nmicroorganisms on the hands.\nThere are two different types of microbes on the hands, transient and resident\nmicrobes. Transient microbes consist of contaminating pathogens which are loosely\nattached to the skin surface and do not survive or multiply. A moderate number of\nthese organisms can be removed with adequate handwashing. Resident microbes\nconsist of a relatively stable population that survive and multiply on the skin and they\nare not easily washed off the hands. Resident microbes on the hands are usually not a\nconcern for potential contamination in food service.\nAll aspects of proper handwashing are important in reducing microbial transients on the\nhands. However, friction and water have been found to play the most important role.\nThis is why the amount of time spent scrubbing the hands is critical in proper\nhandwashing. It takes more than just the use of soap and running water to remove the\ntransient pathogens that may be present. It is the abrasive action obtained by\nvigorously rubbing the surfaces being cleaned that loosens the transient\nmicroorganisms on the hands.\nResearch has shown a minimum 10-15 second scrub is necessary to remove transient\npathogens from the hands and when an antimicrobial soap is used, a minimum of 15\nseconds is required. Soap is important for the surfactant effect in removing soil from\nthe hands and a warm water temperature is important in achieving the maximum\nsurfactant effect of the soap.\nEvery stage in handwashing is equally important and has an additive effect in transient\nmicrobial reduction. Therefore, effective handwashing must include scrubbing, rinsing,\nand drying the hands. When done properly, each stage of handwashing further\ndecreases the transient microbial load on the hands. It is equally important to avoid\nrecontaminating hands by avoiding direct hand contact with heavily contaminated\nenvironmental sources, such as manually operated handwashing sink faucets, paper\ntowel dispensers, and rest room door handles after the handwashing procedure. This\ncan be accomplished by obtaining a paper towel from its dispenser before the\nhandwashing procedure, then, after handwashing, using the paper towel to operate the\nhand sink faucet handles and restroom door handles.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\n\nHandwashing done properly can result in a 2-3 log reduction in transient bacteria and a\n2-log reduction in transient viruses and protozoa. With heavy contamination of\ntransient microbial pathogens, (i.e., > 104 microbes, as found on hands contaminated\nwith bodily wastes and infected bodily fluids) handwashing may be ineffective in\ncompletely decontaminating the hands. Therefore, a further intervention such as a\nbarrier between hands and ready-to-eat food is necessary.",

Special Handwash Procedures\n\n2-301.13 Special Handwash Procedures.\nIn earlier editions of the Code, FDA's model contained a provision for a Special\nProcedure in certain situations.

When to Wash\n\n2-301.14 When to Wash.\nThe hands may become contaminated when the food employee engages in specific\nactivities. The increased risk of contamination requires handwashing immediately\nbefore, during, or after the activities listed. The specific examples listed in this Code\nsection are not intended to be all inclusive. Employees must wash their hands after any\nactivity which may result in contamination of the hands.\n\n2-301.15. Where to Wash\n\n2-301.15 Where to Wash.\nEffective handwashing is essential for minimizing the likelihood of the hands becoming\na vehicle of cross contamination. It is important that handwashing be done only at a\nproperly equipped handwashing facility in order to help ensure that food employees\neffectively clean their hands. Handwashing sinks are to be conveniently located,\nalways accessible for handwashing, maintained so they provide proper water\ntemperatures and pressure, and equipped with suitable hand cleansers, nail brushes,\nand disposable towels and waste containers, or hand dryers. It is inappropriate to wash\nhands in a food preparation sink since this may result in avoidable contamination of the\nsink and the food prepared therein. Service sinks may not be used for food employee\nhandwashing since this practice may introduce additional hand contaminants because\nthese sinks may be used for the disposal of mop water, toxic chemicals, and a variety of\nother liquid wastes. Such wastes may contain pathogens from cleaning the floors of\nfood preparation areas and toilet rooms and discharges from ill persons.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines",

    "content": "2-301.16 Hand Antiseptics.\nIn the 2005 Food Code, the use of the term \u201chand sanitizer\u201d was replaced by the term\n\u201chand antiseptic\u201d to eliminate confusion with the term \u201csanitizer,\u201d a defined term in the\nFood Code, and to more closely reflect the terminology used in the FDA Tentative Final\nMonograph for Health-Care Antiseptic Drug Products for OTC Human Use, Federal\nRegister: 1994-06-17.\nThe term \u201csanitizer\u201d is typically used to describe control of bacterial contamination of\ninert objects or articles, or equipment and utensils, and other cleaned food-contact\nsurfaces. The Food Code definition of \u201csanitizer\u201d requires a minimum microbial\nreduction of 5 logs, which is equal to a 99.999% reduction. The FDA bases the 5-log\nreduction on the AOAC International\u2019s \u201cOfficial Methods of Analysis 2003,\u201d which\nrequires a minimum 5-log reduction in microorganisms to achieve \u201csanitization.\u201d\nSanitizers used to disinfect food-contact equipment and utensils can easily achieve the\n5-log reduction of microorganisms and often far exceed this minimum requirement.\nHowever, removing microorganisms from human skin is a totally different process and\nsterilization of human skin is nearly impossible to achieve without damaging the skin.\nMany antimicrobial hand agents typically achieve a much smaller reduction in\nmicroorganisms than the 5-log reduction required for \u201csanitization.\u201d Therefore, the\neffect achieved from using antimicrobial hand agents is not consistent with the definition\nof \u201csanitization\u201d in the Food Code.\nThe word \u201cantiseptic\u201d is a Greek term, meaning \u201cagainst putrefaction\u201d, and eventually\nevolved into a second definition, meaning, \u201ca substance used to destroy pathogenic\nmicroorganisms.\u201d The term \u201cantiseptic\u201d is often used to describe agents used on skin to\nprevent infection of the skin.\n\u201cAntiseptic\u201d is defined under section 201 (o) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic\nAct (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321 (o)), as: \u201cThe representation of a drug, in its labeling, as an\nantiseptic shall be considered to be a representation of a germicide, except in the case\nof a drug purporting to be, or represented as, an antiseptic for inhibitory use as a wet\ndressing, ointment, dusting powder, or such other use as involves prolonged contact\nwith the body.\u201d\nSection 333.403 of the FDA Tentative Final Monograph for Health-Care Antiseptic Drug\nProducts for OTC Human Use, Federal Register: 1994-06-17, defines a \u201chealth-care\nantiseptic\u201d as an antiseptic-containing drug product applied topically to the skin to help\nprevent infection or to help prevent cross contamination. An \u201cantiseptic handwash\u201d or\n\u201chealth-care personnel handwash drug product\u201d is defined in Section 333.403 of the\nMonograph as an antiseptic containing preparation designed for frequent use; it\nreduces the number of transient microorganisms on intact skin to an initial baseline\nlevel after adequate washing, rinsing, and drying; it is a broad spectrum, and persistent\nantiseptic containing preparation that significantly reduces the number of\nmicroorganisms on intact skin.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nReplacing the term \u201chand sanitizer\u201d with the term \u201chand antiseptic\u201d allows the use of a\nmore scientifically appropriate term that is used to describe reduction of\nmicroorganisms on the skin and will improve clarification and regulation of these\nproducts.\nThe provisions of \u00a7 2-301.16 are intended to ensure that an antimicrobial product\napplied to the hands is 1) safe and effective when applied to human skin, and 2) a safe\nfood additive when applied to bare hands that will come into direct contact with food.\nBecause of the need to protect workers and to ensure safe food, hand antiseptics must\ncomply with both the human drug and the food safety provisions of the law. The\nprohibition against bare hand contact contained in \u00b6 3-301.11(B) applies only to an\nexposed ready-to-eat food.\nAs a Drug Product\nThere are two means by which a hand antiseptic is considered to be safe and effective\nwhen applied to human skin:\n\n1. A hand antiseptic may be approved by FDA under a new drug application\nbased on data showing safety and effectiveness and may be listed in the\npublication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations.\n(http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/default.cfm. This document is\nmaintained by the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and\nResearch, Office of Pharmaceutical Science, Office of Generic Drugs. Also\nknown as the \u201cOrange Book,\u201d this document provides \u201cproduct-specific\u201d listings\nrather than listings by compound and it is published annually with monthly\nsupplements. However, as of the end of 1998, no hand antiseptics are listed in\nthis publication since no new drug applications have been submitted and\napproved for these products.\n\n2. A hand antiseptic active ingredient may be identified by FDA in the monograph\nfor OTC (over-the-counter) Health-Care Antiseptic Drug Products under the\nantiseptic handwash category. Since hand antiseptic products are intended and\nlabeled for topical antimicrobial use by food employees in the prevention of\ndisease in humans, these products are \"drugs\" under the Federal Food, Drug,\nand Cosmetic Act \u00a7 201(g). As drugs, hand antiseptics and dips must be\nmanufactured by an establishment that is duly registered with the FDA as a drug\nmanufacturer; their manufacturing, processing, packaging, and labeling must be\nperformed in conformance with drug Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP's);\nand the product must be listed with FDA as a drug product.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nProducts having the same formulation, labeling, and dosage form as those that existed\nin the marketplace on or before 1975-12-04, for hand antiseptic use by food\nhandlers, are being evaluated under the Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drug Review by\nFDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. However, as of May 2005, a final\nOTC drug monograph for these products has not been finalized. Therefore, FDA has\nnot made a final determination that any of these products are generally recognized as\nsafe and effective (GRAS/E).\nGRAS/E antimicrobial ingredients for hand sanitizer use by food handlers will be\nidentified in a future final monograph issued under the OTC Drug Review. Information\nabout whether a specific product is covered by the proposed monograph may be\nobtained from the tentative final monograph (TFM) for \u201cHealth Care Antiseptic Drug\nProducts for OTC Human Use; Proposed Rule.\u201d This TFM, which was published in the\nFederal Register of 1994-06-17 (59 FR 31402), describes the inclusion of hand\nsanitizers in this Review on page 31440 under Comment 28 of Part II. Information\nabout whether a specific product is included in this proposed monograph may also be\navailable from the manufacturer.\nQuestions regarding acceptability of a hand antiseptic with respect to OTC compliance\nmay be directed to the Office of Unapproved Drugs and Labeling Compliance, Center\nfor Drug Evaluation & Research Food and Drug Administration 10903 New Hampshire\nAve., Building 51, 5th Floor, Silver Spring, MD 20993.

A review by FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied\nNutrition is required in order to determine whether such an exemption can be\ngranted.\n\n2. The intended use of a substance, including substances that contact food such as\nthose in hand antiseptics, may be \u201cgenerally recognized as safe (GRAS)\u201d within\nthe meaning of the FFDCA. A partial listing of substances with food uses that\nare generally recognized as safe may be found in CFR Parts 182, 184, and 186.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nThese lists are not exhaustive because the FFDCA allows for independent\nGRAS determinations.\nFor the use of a substance to be GRAS within the meaning of the FFDCA, there\nmust be publicly available data that demonstrate that the substance is safe for its\nintended use. There also must be a basis to conclude that there is a consensus\namong qualified experts that these publicly available data establish safety. If the\nuse of a substance in food is GRAS, it is not subject to premarket review by\nFDA. While there is no legal requirement to notify FDA of an independent GRAS\ndetermination, a number of firms have chosen to do so with the expectation of\nreceiving a response letter from FDA (see FDA\u2019s Inventory of GRAS Notices at\n(http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/GenerallyRecognizedasSaf\neGRAS/GRASListings/default.htm). Although such a letter does not affirm the\nindependent GRAS determination, it is an opportunity for the firm to receive\ncomment from FDA regarding the materials supporting its determination.\n\n3. The intended use of a substance may be the subject of a prior sanction, which is\nan explicit approval by the FDA or the United States Department of Agriculture\n(USDA) prior to 1958-09-06.

This list is available on-line at: Inventory of\nEffective Food Contact Substance (FCS) Notifications\n(http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodContactSubstancesFC\nS/ucm116567.htm). A food-contact substance that is the subject of an effective\nnotification submitted under FFDCA 409(h) does not include similar or identical\nsubstances manufactured or prepared by any person other than the\nmanufacturer identified in that notification.\nThe Division of Food Contact Substance Notifications does not certify or provide\napprovals for specific products. However, if the intended use of a substance in contact\nwith food meets the requirements of 21 CFR 170.39 Threshold of regulation for\nsubstances used in food-contact articles, FDA may provide a letter to a firm stating that\nthe intended use of this product is exempt from regulation as a food additive.

Failure\nto remove fecal material from beneath the fingernails after defecation can be a major\nsource of pathogenic organisms. Ragged fingernails present cleanability concerns and\nmay harbor pathogenic organisms.\nJewelry 2-303.11 Prohibition.\nItems of jewelry such as rings, bracelets, and watches may collect soil and the\nconstruction of the jewelry may hinder routine cleaning. As a result, the jewelry may\nact as a reservoir of pathogenic organisms transmissible through food.\nThe term \u201cjewelry\u201d generally refers to the ornaments worn for personal adornment and\nmedical alert bracelets do not fit this definition. However, the wearing of such bracelets\ncarries the same potential for transmitting disease-causing organisms to food. If a food\nworker wears a medical alert or medical information bracelet, the conflict between this\nneed and the Food Code\u2019s requirements can be resolved through reasonable\naccommodation in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The person in\ncharge should discuss the Food Code requirement with the employee and together they\ncan work out an acceptable alternative to a bracelet. For example, the medical alert\ninformation could be worn in the form of a necklace or anklet to provide the necessary\nmedical information without posing a risk to food.

    "content": "2-501.11 Clean-up of Vomiting and Diarrheal Events.\nWhen an employee, customer, or other individual vomits or has a diarrheal event in a\nfood establishment, there is a real potential for the spread of harmful pathogens in the\nestablishment. Putting the proper response into action in a timely manner can help\nreduce the likelihood that food may become contaminated and that others may become\nill as a result of the accident.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nAccording to the CDC, Norovirus is the leading cause of foodborne disease outbreaks\nin the United States. More specifically, Noroviruses are the most common cause of\nsporadic cases and outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis. Norovirus is the most common\ncause of gastroenteritis in people of all ages and it is responsible for greater than 50%\nof all foodborne gastroenteritis outbreaks. CDC estimates that 21 million cases of\nacute gastroenteritis are due to Norovirus infection.\nNoroviruses can be highly contagious, and it is thought that an inoculum of as few as\n10-18 viral particles may be sufficient to infect an individual. Transmission occurs via\nfoodborne and person-to-person routes, airborne inhalation of vomitus droplets, and\nalso through contact with contaminated environmental surfaces. Good evidence exists\nfor transmission due to aerosolization of vomitus that presumably results in droplets\ncontaminating surfaces or entering the oral mucosa and being swallowed.\nIn addition, the potential transmission level of Norovirus shed in the feces at levels up to\n1 trillion viral particles per gram of feces and one projectile vomiting incident can\ncontaminate the environment with 300,000 viral particles. One study found that\nemployees who reported having cleaned up vomitus were more likely to contract illness\nthat those who did not.\nNorovirus causes acute onset of vomiting (often explosive) and diarrhea (also often\nexplosive) which can contaminate surfaces and become airborne increasing the\nchances of additional infections. A recent study has also shown that the bathroom\nenvironment was identified as a major reservoir of human Norovirus, even in the\nabsence of an ill individual on site. Studies have shown that Norovirus can survive on\nfomite surfaces for up to at least 5 days at room temperature and that routine cleaning,\nwithout a disinfectant specifically to address Norovirus, may be ineffective in eliminating\nits presence on fomite surfaces and can even serve as a means of spreading the virus\nto other fomites.\nEffective clean up of vomitus and fecal matter in a food establishment should be\nhandled differently from routine cleaning procedures. It should involve a more stringent\ncleaning and disinfecting process. Some compounds that are routinely used for\nsanitizing food-contact surfaces and disinfecting countertops and floors, such as certain\nquaternary ammonium compounds, may not be effective against Norovirus. It is\ntherefore important that food establishments have procedures for the cleaning and\ndisinfection of vomitus and/or diarrheal contamination events that address, among other\nitems, the use of proper disinfectants at the proper concentration.\nConsumers are at risk of contracting Norovirus illness from direct exposure to vomitus\nor from exposure to airborne Norovirus from vomitus. Additionally, exposed food\nemployees are also at risk of contracting Norovirus illness and can subsequently\ntransfer the virus to ready-to-eat food items served to consumers.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nThe Food Code specifies that the Person in Charge is to exclude or restrict a food\nemployee who exhibits, or reports a symptom, or who reports a diagnosed illness or a\nhistory of exposure to Norovirus. A clean-up and response plan is intended to address\nsituations where a food employee or other individual becomes physically ill in areas\nwhere food may be prepared, stored or served. Once such an episode has occurred,\ntimely effective clean-up is imperative.\nWhen developing a plan that addresses the need for the cleaning and disinfection of a\nvomitus and/or diarrheal contamination event, a food establishment should consider:\n\u2022\t the procedures for containment and removal of any discharges, including\nairborne particulates;\n\u2022\t the procedure for cleaning, sanitizing, and, as necessary, the disinfection of\nany surfaces that may have become contaminated;\n\u2022\t the procedures for the evaluation and disposal of any food that may have\nbeen exposed to discharges;\n\u2022\t the availability of effective disinfectants, personal protective equipment, and\nother cleaning and disinfecting equipment and appurtenances intended for\nresponse and their proper use;\n\u2022\t procedures for the disposal and/or cleaning and disinfection of tools and\nequipment used to clean up vomitus or fecal matter;\n\u2022\t the circumstances under which a food employee is to wear personal\nprotective equipment for cleaning and disinfecting of a contaminated area;\n\u2022\t notification to food employees on the proper use of personal protective\nequipment and procedures to follow in containing, cleaning, and disinfecting a\ncontaminated area;\n\u2022\t the segregation of areas that may have been contaminated so as to minimize\nthe unnecessary exposure of employees, customers and others in the facility\nto the discharges or to surfaces or food that may have become\ncontaminated;\n\u2022\t minimizing risk of disease transmission through the exclusion and restriction\nof ill employees as specified in \u00a7 2-201.12 of the Food Code;\n\u2022\t minimizing risk of disease transmission through the prompt removal of ill\ncustomers and others from areas of food preparation, service and storage;\nand\n\u2022\t the conditions under which the plan will be implemented.\nWhen a food employee has been diagnosed, has recent history or exposure to, or is\nthe suspect source of a confirmed disease outbreak of Norovirus, it must be reported to\nthe person in charge per the FDA Food Code in subparagraphs 2-201.11 (A)(2)(a),\n2-201.11(A)(4)(a), 2-201.11(A)(5)(a), and \u00b62-201.11(B).

Source\nA primary line of defense in ensuring that food meets the requirements of \u00a7 3-101.11 is\nto obtain food from approved sources, the implications of which are discussed below.\nHowever, it is also critical to monitor food products to ensure that, after harvesting and\nprocessing, they do not fall victim to conditions that endanger their safety, make them\nadulterated, or compromise their honest presentation. The regulatory community,\nindustry, and consumers should exercise vigilance in controlling the conditions to which\nfoods are subjected and be alert to signs of abuse. FDA considers food in hermetically\nsealed containers that are swelled or leaking to be adulterated and actionable under the\nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Depending on the circumstances, rusted and\npitted or dented cans may also present a serious potential hazard.\nFood, at all stages of production, is susceptible to contamination. The source of food is\nimportant because pathogenic microorganisms may be present in the breeding stock of\nfarm animals, in feeds, in the farm environment, in waters used for raising and freezing\naquatic foods, and in soils and fertilizers in which plant crops are grown. Chemical\ncontaminants that may be present in field soils, fertilizers, irrigation water, and fishing\nwaters can be incorporated into food plants and animals.\nSources of molluscan shellfish are a particular concern because shellfish are frequently\nconsumed raw or in an undercooked state and thus receive neither heat treatment nor\nany other process that would destroy or inactivate microbial pathogens. For safety,\nthese foods must be accompanied by certification that documents that they have been\nharvested from waters that meet the water quality standards contained in the National\nShellfish Sanitation Program Guide for the Control of Molluscan Shellfish. Certification\nalso provides confidence that processing, packaging, and shipping have been\nconducted under sanitary conditions.\nFood should be purchased from commercial supplies under regulatory control. Home\nkitchens, with their varieties of food and open entry to humans and pet animals, are\nfrequently implicated in the microbial contamination of food. Because commercial items\nseldom are eaten right away, the home kitchen's limited capacity for maintaining food at\nproper temperatures may result in considerable microbial growth and toxin production\nby microorganisms introduced through the diverse sources of contamination.\nControlled processing is required for the safe preparation of food entering commerce.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nLabeling - General\nSources of packaged food must be labeled in accordance with law. Proper labeling of\nfoods allows consumers to make informed decisions about what they eat. Many\nconsumers, as a result of an existing medical condition, may be sensitive to specific\nfoods or food ingredients. This sensitivity may result in dangerous medical\nconsequences should certain foods or ingredients be unknowingly consumed. In\naddition, consumers have a basic right to be protected from misbranding and fraud.\nExcept for certain species of large tuna and raw molluscan shellfish, if fish are intended\nfor raw consumption, they must be properly frozen before they are served. If this\nprocess is done off-premises, purchase specifications ensuring that proper freezing\ntechniques are used to destroy parasites must be provided. Labeling should\naccompany the product to advise as to whether the product was frozen properly. This is\nnecessary because fish from natural bodies of water may carry parasitic worms that can\ninfect and injure consumers who eat such raw fish dishes as sushi, ceviche, green\n(lightly marinated) herring, and cold-smoked salmon. The worms are often deeply\nimbedded inside fish muscle. Thorough freezing kills these worms if the fish are\nsubjected to a low enough temperature for a long enough time.\nLabeling for Fish\nExcept for raw molluscan shellfish, certain species of large tuna, certain aquacultured\nfish, and fish eggs that have been removed from the skein and rinsed, if fish are\nintended for raw or undercooked consumption, they must be properly frozen before\nthey are served. If this process is done off-premises, purchase specifications ensuring\nthat proper freezing techniques are used to destroy parasites must be provided.\nLabeling or other information should accompany the product to advise as to whether\nthe product was frozen properly. This is necessary because fish from natural bodies of\nwater may carry parasitic worms that can infect and injure consumers who eat such raw\nfish dishes as sushi, ceviche, green (lightly marinated) herring, and cold-smoked\nsalmon. The worms are often deeply imbedded inside fish muscle. Thorough freezing\nkills these worms if the fish are subjected to a low enough temperature for a long\nenough time.\nLabeling for Juice\nOn 1998-07-08, FDA announced in the Federal Register a final rule that revised its\nfood labeling regulations to require a warning statement on fruit and vegetable juice\nproducts that have not been processed to prevent, reduce, or eliminate pathogenic\nmicroorganisms that may be present. FDA took this action to inform consumers,\nparticularly those at greatest risk, of the hazard posed by such juice products. FDA\nexpects that providing this information to consumers will allow them to make informed\ndecisions on whether to purchase and consume such juice products, thereby reducing\nthe incidence of foodborne illnesses and deaths caused by the consumption of these\njuices.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines",

    "content": "Annex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nOn 2001-07-18 FDA announced a final rule designed to improve the safety of fruit and\nvegetable juice and juice products. Under the rule, juice processors must use Hazard\nAnalysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles for juice processing. Processors\nmaking shelf-stable juices or concentrates that use a single thermal processing step are\nexempt from the microbial hazard requirements of the HACCP regulation. Retail\nestablishments where packaged juice is made and only sold directly to consumers\n(such as juice bars) are not required to comply with this regulation.\nRather, the Food Code requires fresh fruit or vegetable juices that are packaged at\nretail (untreated juices or beverages containing untreated juices that are offered to\nconsumers as prepackaged foods) to be processed under HACCP with a 5 log\nreduction in pathogens of concern OR bear the warning statement as specified in\n21 CFR Section 101.17(g). That statement is: \u201cWARNING: This product has not been\npasteurized and, therefore, may contain harmful bacteria that can cause serious illness\nin children, the elderly, and persons with weakened immune systems.\u201d Refer to\nChapter 1 for the definition of juice. It is important to note that the definition of \"juice\"\nincludes pur\u00e9ed fruits and vegetables, which are commonly prepared for service to\nhighly susceptible populations.\nFood establishments that serve a highly susceptible population (HSP) cannot serve\nprepackaged juice that bears the warning label and they must serve only pasteurized\njuice. For juice only, this population includes children who are age 9 or less and receive\nfood in a school, day care setting, or similar facility that provides custodial care.\nUnpackaged juice (glasses of juice prepared at a juice bar, for example) does not\nrequire the 5 log reduction nor a warning statement or other consumer advisory (juice is\nnot an animal food and therefore not covered by section 3-603.11) when prepared and\nserved at retail. Usually the juice is served by the glass or in small batches compared\nto a commercial juice processor. The risk of using \u201cdrops\u201d and damaged fruits or\nvegetables is much less at retail because of buyer specs that provide higher quality\nproduce, meaning that fruits for juicing are less likely to be of a lower quality or\ndamaged.\nAdditional information is available in the document, \u201cGuidance for Industry: Exemptions\nfrom the Warning Label Requirement for Juice - Recommendations for Effectively\nAchieving a 5-Log Pathogen Reduction; Final Guidance\u201d, 2002-10-07 which can\nbe found at:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformati\non/LabelingNutrition/ucm058962.htm or obtained from the FDA Office of Nutritional\nProducts Labeling and Dietary Supplements.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nLabeling for Meat and Poultry\nRetail food establishments that process and package meat or poultry in a form that is\nnot ready-to-eat, are obligated by Federal regulation to label the product with safe food\nhandling instructions. USDA issued final rules on 1994-08-08 requiring all raw meat\nor poultry products have a safe-handling label or sticker or be accompanied by a leaflet\nthat contains information on proper handling and cooking procedures. The intent of this\nrequirement is to ensure that all consumers are alerted to the fact that such products\nmay contain bacteria and that food safety hinges upon their thoroughly cooking the\nproduct, regardless of where they obtain the products. That is, the labeling would exist\nif they obtain their meat and poultry at an establishment that handles only prepackaged\nand prelabeled products or if they obtain their meat or poultry at an operation such as a\nsupermarket with a meat processing operation or from a small neighborhood butcher.\nLabeling Guidance for Irradiated Raw Meat and Meat Products\nIn December 1999, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection\nService (USDA/FSIS) issued a final regulation to permit the use of ionizing radiation to\nreduce foodborne pathogens, including Escherichia coli O157:H7, and extend the shelf\nlife of raw refrigerated and frozen meat and meat products (Irradiation of Meat Food\nProducts 64 Federal Register 72150, 1999-12-23).\nThe final regulations are published in Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR\n424.21 Use of food ingredients and sources of radiation and provide that raw\nrefrigerated products may receive a maximum absorbed dose of no more than 4.5 kGy,\nand that frozen product receive no more than 7.0 kGy, in accordance with the FDA\nrestrictions provided for in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR\n179.26(a) Ionizing radiation for the treatment of food, (a) Energy sources). The\nregulations further require that all irradiated meat and meat products bear labeling that\nreflects that the product was irradiated, or that the product contains an irradiated meat\nor poultry product. This labeling requirement is applicable even at retail facilities where\nirradiated coarse ground beef might be finely ground for retail sale, or in cases where\nirradiated product is combined with other non-irradiated meat or poultry product for\nretail sale.\nIn cases where the entire package of product is irradiated, the labeling must include\nboth a statement and the international symbol, called the radura. Additionally, the\nproduct name must include the word \u201cirradiated,\u201d or the labeling must bear a disclosure\nstatement such as, \u201ctreated with radiation\u201d or \u201ctreated by irradiation.\u201d If either statement\nis used, the logo must be placed in conjunction with the statement. If an irradiated\nmeat or meat product is used to formulate a multi-ingredient product with other nonirradiated components, the irradiated meat ingredient must be identified as such in the\ningredients statement, but the logo is not required. For example, the ingredients\nstatement for a Chicken and Beef Sausage product that contains irradiated beef would\nbe, Ingredients: chicken, irradiated beef, seasonings (salt, pepper, spice), and the logo\nwould not be required to be present.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines",

If such statements indicate a specific\nbenefit from irradiation, such as a reduction of microbial pathogens, such statements\nmust be substantiated by processing documentation and validated through the\nprocessing and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system. Such\nvalidation and documentation of the HACCP system would only be applicable in\nfederally inspected establishments.\nBecause irradiation can substantially reduce and, in some situations, eliminate any\ndetectable level of pathogenic bacteria, it is important that the meat products be held at\nthe proper refrigerated temperatures to prevent growth of any pathogens present, and\nthat the packaging is not compromised. Although co-mingling irradiated beef with nonirradiated meat or poultry is not prohibited under the current regulations, USDA/FSIS\nbelieves that such a process would decrease the benefit of irradiation by potentially\nexposing the irradiated product to pathogenic bacteria. While FSIS considers such\ncomingling to be highly unlikely, if it did occur, a statement advising the consumer that\nthe product contains both irradiated and non-irradiated components would be required.\nThe Radura, International Symbol:\nFurther information about labeling irradiated raw meat is available through Directive\n7700.1, Irradiation of Meat and Poultry Products, on the USDA/FSIS website at\nhttp://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/058dd732-7fc8-4787-a283\u00ad\n30ed50d6f7e0/7700.1Rev1.pdf?MOD=AJPERES.

Hazards known to be associated with specific fish species are discussed\nin the FDA Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guide, available from the\nFDA Office of Seafood. Species-related hazards include pathogens, parasites, natural\ntoxins, histamine, chemicals, and drugs.\nThe seafood implicated in histamine poisoning are the scombroid toxin-forming species,\ndefined in 21 CFR 123.3(m) as meaning bluefish, mahi-mahi, tuna, and other species,\nwhether or not in the family Scombridae, in which significant levels of histamine may\nbe produced in the fish flesh by decarboxylation of free histidine as a result of exposure\nof the fish after capture to temperatures that allow the growth of mesophilic bacteria.\nCiguatera toxin is carried to humans by contaminated fin fish from the extreme\nsoutheastern U.S., Hawaii, and subtropical and tropical areas worldwide. In the south\nFlorida, Bahamian, and Caribbean regions, barracuda, amberjack, horse-eye jack,\nblack jack, other large species of jack, king mackerel, large groupers, and snappers are\nparticularly likely to contain ciguatoxin. Many other species of large predatory fishes\nmay be suspect. In Hawaii and throughout the central Pacific, barracuda, amberjack,\nand snapper are frequently ciguatoxic, and many other species both large and small are\nsuspect. Mackerel and barracuda are frequently ciguatoxic from mid to northeastern\nAustralian waters.\nRECREATIONALLY CAUGHT FISH\nRecreationally caught fish received for sale or service may be approved by the\nregulatory authority. The EPA recognizes that fish are a healthy part of our diet and\nrecognizes fishing as an all-American recreational pastime, however, they add the\ncautionary note that some individuals, such as pregnant women and small children,\nmay need to limit their intake of certain noncommercial fish. Recreationally caught fish\nmay contain possible contaminants that may pose health risks. Fish advisories can be\nfound in EPA Listing of Fish Advisories the EPA website at:\nhttp://www.epa.gov/waterscience/fish/.\nStates issue fish consumption advisories if elevated concentrations of chemicals such\nas mercury or dioxin are found in local fish. For most people, the risk from mercury by\neating fish is not a health concern. Yet, some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of\nmercury that may harm an unborn baby or young child's developing nervous system.\nTherefore, the FDA and the EPA recently advised women who may become pregnant,\npregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children to avoid some types of fish and\neat fish and shellfish that are lower in mercury.\n(http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/fishadvice/advice.html).\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\n\nState-issued advisories apply primarily to non-commercial fish obtained through sport,\nrecreation, and subsistence activities. Each advisory is different; it may recommend\nunrestricted, limited, or totally restricted consumption; may be targeted to everyone or\nlimited to women, children, or other people at risk; and may apply to certain species or\nsizes of fish or a specific waterbody.\nStates may issue safe-eating guidelines in addition to issuing fish advisories. A fish\nadvisory is issued to warn the public of the potential human health risks from chemical\ncontamination of certain species from particular types of waterbodies such as lakes,\nrivers, and/ or coastal waters within the State. In contrast, a safe-eating guideline is\nissued to inform the public that fish from specific waterbodies have been tested for\nchemical contaminants and the fish from these waters are safe to eat without\nconsumption restrictions.\nRegulatory authorities are encouraged to monitor and review the National Listing of Fish\nAdvisories (See August 2004 EPA Fact Sheet at\nhttp://www.epa.gov/waterscience/fish/advisories/factsheet.pdf as well as the local\nlistings, as part of the decision-making process regarding the approval of recreationally\ncaught fish being used in food establishments.",

Molluscan shellfish include: 1) oysters; 2) clams; 3) mussels;\nand, 4) scallops, except where the final product is the shucked adductor muscle only.\nThe pathogens of concern include both bacteria and viruses.\nPathogens from the harvest area are of particular concern in molluscan shellfish\nbecause: 1) environments in which molluscan shellfish grow are commonly subject to\ncontamination from sewage, which may contain pathogens, and to naturally occurring\nbacteria, which may also be pathogens; 2) molluscan shellfish filter and concentrate\npathogens that may be present in surrounding waters; and, 3) molluscan shellfish are\noften consumed whole, either raw or partially cooked.\nTo minimize the risk of molluscan shellfish containing pathogens of sewage origin, State\nand foreign government agencies, called Shellfish Control Authorities, classify waters in\nwhich molluscan shellfish are found, based, in part, on an assessment of water quality.\nAs a result of these classifications, molluscan shellfish harvesting is allowed from some\nwaters, not from others, and only at certain times or under certain restrictions from\nothers. Shellfish Control Authorities then exercise control over the molluscan shellfish\nharvesters to ensure that harvesting takes place only when and where it has been\nallowed.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nSignificant elements of Shellfish Control Authorities' efforts to control the harvesting of\nmolluscan shellfish include: 1) a requirement that containers of in-shell molluscan\nshellfish (shellstock) bear a tag that identifies the type and quantity of shellfish,\nharvester, harvest location, and date of harvest; and, 2) a requirement that molluscan\nshellfish harvesters be licensed; 3) a requirement that processors that shuck molluscan\nshellfish or ship, reship, or repack the shucked product be certified; and, 4) a\nrequirement that containers of shucked molluscan shellfish bear a label with the name,\naddress, and certification number of the shucker-packer or repacker.\nPathogens, such as Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio cholerae,\nand Listeria monocytogenes that may be present in low numbers at the time that\nmolluscan shellfish are harvested, may increase to more hazardous levels if they are\nexposed to time/temperature abuse. To minimize the risk of pathogen growth, Shellfish\nControl Authorities place limits on the time between harvest and refrigeration. The\nlength of time is dependant upon either the month of the year or the average monthly\nmaximum air temperature (AMMAT) at the time of harvest, which is determined by the\nShellfish Control Authority.\nParalytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) results from shellfish feeding upon toxic\nmicroorganisms such as dinoflagellates. In the U.S., PSP is generally associated with\nthe consumption of molluscan shellfish from the northeast and northwest coastal\nregions of the U.S. PSP in other parts of the world has been associated with molluscan\nshellfish from environments ranging from tropical to temperate waters. In addition, in\nthe U.S., PSP toxin has recently been reported from the viscera of mackerel, lobster,\ndungeness crabs, tanner crabs, and red rock crabs.\nNeurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP) in the U.S. is generally associated with the\nconsumption of molluscan shellfish harvested along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico,\nand, sporadically, along the southern Atlantic coast. There has been a significant\noccurrence of toxins similar to NSP in New Zealand, and some suggestions of\noccurrence elsewhere.\nFor diarrhetic shellfish poisoning there has been no documented occurrence to date in\nthe U.S. However, instances have been documented in Japan, southeast Asia,\nScandinavia, western Europe, Chile, New Zealand, and eastern Canada.\nAmnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) is generally associated with the consumption of\nmolluscan shellfish from the northeast and northwest coasts of North America. It has\nnot yet been a problem in the Gulf of Mexico, although the algae that produce the toxin\nhave been found there. ASP toxin has recently been identified as a problem in the\nviscera of dungeness crab, tanner crab, red rock crab, and anchovies along the west\ncoast of the United States.\nMarine toxins are not ordinarily a problem in scallops if only the adductor muscle is\nconsumed. However, products such as roe-on scallops and whole scallops do present\na potential hazard for natural toxins.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nTo reduce the risk of illness associated with raw shellfish consumption, the Food and\nDrug Administration (FDA) administers the National Shellfish Sanitation Program\n(NSSP). The NSSP is a tripartite, cooperative action plan involving Federal and State\npublic health officials and the shellfish industry. Those groups work together to improve\nshellfish safety. States regularly monitor waters to ensure that they are safe before\nharvesting is permitted. FDA routinely audits the States' classification of shellfish\nharvesting areas to verify that none pose a threat to public health. Patrolling of closed\nshellfishing waters minimizes the threat of illegal harvesting or \"bootlegging\" from\nclosed waters. Bootlegging is a criminal activity and a major factor in shellfish-borne\nillnesses. Purchases from certified dealers that adhere to NSSP controls is essential to\nkeep risks to a minimum.",

It is known that about 15 species are\ndeadly and another 60 are toxic to humans whether they are consumed raw or cooked.\nAn additional 36 species are suspected of being poisonous, whether raw or cooked. At\nleast 40 other species are poisonous if eaten raw, but are safe after proper cooking.\nSome wild mushrooms that are extremely poisonous may be difficult to distinguish from\nedible species. In most parts of the country there is at least one organization that\nincludes individuals who can provide assistance with both identification and program\ndesign. Governmental agencies, universities, and mycological societies are examples\nof such groups.\nRegulatory authorities have expressed their difficulty in regulating wild harvested\nmushrooms at retail. There are many different approaches in regulating the sale and\nservice of wild harvested mushrooms. The differences in approach could be due to\ngeography, the type of wild mushrooms that typically grow in a particular region and/or\nlocal/state laws that are enforced. The Conference for Food Protection (CFP) has\nattempted to develop a national model or standards for regulatory programs to address\nand recognize wild harvested mushroom identification. The difficulty in trying to get\nconsensus on national model/standards lies in the question of what is the best national\nmodel/standard available that state/local regulatory authorities can apply in a\nmeaningful way to ensure wild harvested mushrooms sold at retail are obtained from a\nsafe source.\nWith the change in the codified text, the regulatory authority will have the flexibility to\napply their laws and/or policies for wild harvested mushroom identification. At a\nminimum, when developing a wild harvest mushroom identification program, the\nfollowing elements should be addressed:\n\u2022\t Developing resources & criteria to select wild mushroom species for service or\nsale,\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\n\n\u2022\t Establishing record-keeping and traceability to assure safety of wild harvested\nmushrooms,\n\u2022\t Written buyer specifications that include:\n\na.

A statement that the mushroom was identified while in the fresh states,\nc.\t The name and contact information of the person who identified the\nmushroom and the mushroom seller, and\nd. A statement as to the qualifications and training of the identifier,\nspecifically related to mushroom identification.\n\u2022\t Development of qualifications and training curriculum that could be used for\nfurther training of mushroom identifiers\nIn addition, the CFP has guidance material titled \u201cDraft Model Guidance for Wild\nHarvested Mushrooms\u201d posted on their website at www.foodprotect.org so state and\nlocal regulatory authorities can use the information to develop and implement their own\nwild harvested mushroom program.

Game Animals\n\n\n3-201.17 Game Animals.\nThe primary concern regarding game animals relates to animals obtained in the wild.\nWild game animals may be available as a source of food only if a regulatory inspection\nprogram is in place to ensure that wild animal products are safe. This is important\nbecause wild animals may be carriers of viruses, rickettsiae, bacteria, or parasites that\ncause illness (zoonoses) in humans. Some of these diseases can be severe in the\nhuman host. In addition to the risk posed to consumers of game that is not subject to\nan inspection program, there is risk to those who harvest and prepare wild game\nbecause they may contract infectious diseases such as rabies or tularemia.\nSpecifications\nfor Receiving\n\n\n3-202.11. Temperature\n\n\n3-202.11 Temperature.\nTemperature is one of the prime factors that controls the growth of bacteria in food.\nMany, though not all, types of pathogens and spoilage bacteria are prevented from\nmultiplying to microbiologically significant levels in properly refrigerated foods that are\nnot out of date. USDA published a final rule (63 FR 45663, 1998-08-27 Shell Eggs;\nRefrigeration and Labeling Requirements) to require that shell eggs packed for\nconsumer use be stored and transported at an ambient temperature not to exceed\n7.2\u00baC (45\u00baF).\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\n\nHigh temperatures for a long enough time, such as those associated with thorough\ncooking, kill or inactivate many types of microorganisms. However, cooking does not\nalways destroy the toxins produced in foods by certain bacteria (such as the\nenterotoxins of Staphylococcus aureus). Cooking or hot holding that follows\ntemperature abuse may not make the food safe. Keeping cooked foods hot as required\nin the Code prevents significant regrowth of heat-injured microorganisms and prevents\nrecontamination with bacteria that are newly introduced.\n\n\n3-202.12. Additives\n\n\n3-202.12 Additives.\nIt is imperative for safety that food supplies come from sources that are in compliance\nwith laws regarding chemical additives and contaminants.\nFood additives are substances which, by their intended use, become components of\nfood, either directly or indirectly. They must be strictly regulated. In excessive amounts\nor as a result of unapproved application, additives may be harmful to the consumer.\nUnintentional contaminants or residues also find their way into the food supply. The\ntolerances or safe limits designated for these chemicals are determined by risk\nassessment evaluations based on toxicity studies and consumption estimates.\nFood and Color additives must be used in compliance with a federal food, or color\nadditive regulation, an effective food-contact notification, or a threshold of regulation\nexemption. Such regulations, notifications, and exemptions are generally composed of\nthree parts: the identity of the substance, specifications including purity or physical\nproperties, and limitations on the conditions of use. In order for a food, or color additive\nuse to be in compliance, the use must comply with all three criteria.\nFederal Food Additive regulations are found in Title 21 CFR, Parts 172-180. Color\nadditive regulations are found in Title 21 CFR Parts 73-Subpart A, 74-Subpart A, 81\nand 82. Effective food-contact notifications are listed at\nhttp://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/fcn/fcnNavigation.cfm?rpt=fcsListing&displayAll=f\nalse&page=17, and threshold of regulation exemptions are listed at\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/PackagingFCS/ThresholdRegul\nationExemptions/ucm093685.htm.\nOther substances that are added to food include those prior sanctioned for use in food\nby either the FDA or USDA, or those generally recognized as safe for their intended use\nin food.

If an outbreak occurs, regulatory authorities must move quickly to\nclose affected growing areas or take other appropriate actions to prevent further\nillnesses. Records must be kept for 90 days to allow time for hepatitis A virus\ninfections, which have an incubation period that is significantly longer than other\nshellfish-borne diseases, to come to light. The 90 day requirement is based on the\nfollowing considerations:\nShelf-life of the product..........................................14 days\n\nIncubation period ...................................................56 days\n\nMedical diagnosis and confirmation....................... 5 days\n\nReporting ............................................................... 5 days\n\nEpidemiological investigation .................................10 days\n\nTotal .......................................................................90 days\n\nIn reality and as stated in the provision, the 90-day \u201cclock\u201d starts at the time the\ncontainer of shellstock is emptied. Starting from the date of harvest is not correct\nbecause the shellstock may be sold/consumed in less than the 14 days of shelf life\ncited in the chart above. Therefore, the 90 days may expire and the tag discarded\nbefore an illness is reported and investigated.\nShellstock could be frozen in the food establishment during the 14-day estimated shelf\nlife period, which would effectively stop the clock on the shelf life. The shellstock could\nbe thawed and consumed past the 14-day shelf life. In this case, the 90 days would\nexpire before consumption if the clock started 90 days from the harvest date.\nFreezing shellstock in the food establishment is not usually done because, although\noysters-in-the-shell can be frozen with fair results, they do not have the same texture\nand appearance of a fresh oyster when thawed.

    "content": "3-301.11 Preventing Contamination from Hands.\nIn November 1999, the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for\nFoods (NACMCF) concluded that bare hand contact with ready-to-eat foods can\ncontribute to the transmission of foodborne illness and agreed that the transmission\ncould be interrupted. The NACMCF recommended exclusion/restriction of ill food\nworkers as the first preventative strategy and recognized that this intervention has\nlimitations, such as trying to identify and manage asymptomatic food workers.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nThe three interdependent critical factors in reducing foodborne illness transmitted\nthrough the fecal-oral route, identified by the NACMCF, include exclusion/restriction of\nill food workers; proper handwashing; and no bare hand contact with ready-to-eat\nfoods. Each of these factors is inadequate when utilized independently and may not be\neffective. However, when all three factors are combined and utilized properly, the\ntransmission of fecal-oral pathogens can be controlled. Depending on the microbial\ncontamination level on the hands, handwashing with plain soap and water, as specified\nin the Food Code, may not be an adequate intervention to prevent the transmission of\npathogenic microbes to ready-to-eat foods via hand contact with ready-to-eat foods.\nHandwashing as specified in the Food Code will reduce microbial contamination of the\nhands by 2-3 logs.\nFood employees and conditional employees infected with fecal-oral pathogens can\nshed viral and protozoan pathogens in the feces at levels up to 108 viral particles or\noocysts per gram of feces. Having a high potential contamination level on the hands\ncombined with a very low infectious dose necessary to cause infection are the reasons\nthat FDA believes that handwashing alone is not an effective single barrier in the\ntransmission of these fecal-oral pathogens. The infective dose for Giardia and\nCryptosporidium is believed to be as low as 1-10 oocysts, and as few as 10 virus\nparticles can infect an individual with Norovirus or hepatitis A.\nThe CDC now estimates that Norovirus is the leading cause of foodborne illness in the\nUnited States. Contaminated hands are a significant factor in the transmission of\nenteric viruses, including Norovirus and hepatitis A virus. Further, contamination of\nfood by an infected food worker is the most common mode of transmission of hepatitis\nA in foodborne disease outbreaks. Research has shown the viral transfer rate from\ncontaminated hands to ready-to-eat food to be about 10% and that proper handwashing\nwill significantly reduce the chance of transmitting pathogenic viruses. However, with\nheavy initial contamination of the hands, especially in the subungal space of the fingers,\na basic 2-3 log reduction handwash procedure may not be adequate to prevent the\ntransmission of viral foodborne illness.\nEven though bare hands should never contact exposed, ready-to-eat food, thorough\nhandwashing is important in keeping gloves or other utensils from becoming vehicles\nfor transferring microbes to the food.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nIf a ready-to-eat food is being added as an ingredient to a food item that is\nsubsequently subjected to a pathogen kill step (such as adding cheese or other readyto-eat toppings to a pizza dough or adding vegetables to a raw meat dish before\ncooking) then strict prohibition of bare hand contact is not necessary. Cooking foods to\nthe temperatures required in the Food Code will reduce the likelihood of survival of\npathogens that might be transferred from an employee\u2019s hands to the surface of the\nready-to-eat foods. The exception specifically targets bare hand contact with ready-toeat food at the time it is added as an ingredient to food that will be cooked in the food\nestablishment to the minimum temperatures specified in the Food Code. The exception\ndoes not apply when adding ready-to-eat foods as ingredients to foods that will only be\nlightly heated, melted, or browned rather than cooked to the minimum temperatures\nspecified in this section. Nor does this exception apply when adding ready-to-eat foods\nas ingredients to foods that are intended for preparation by the consumer offsite. When\nproper heat treatment is used in combination with the exclusion/restriction of ill food\nworkers and proper handwashing, the proper heat treatment provides an additional\nmeans of interrupting disease transmission.\nRefer to the public health reasons for \u00a7\u00a7 2-301.11, 2-301.12, and 2-301.\n\n14. 3-301.11(E) Prior Approval for Food Employees to Touch\nReady-to-Eat Food with Bare Hands\nInfected food employees are the source of contamination in approximately one in five\nfoodborne disease outbreaks reported in the United States with a bacterial or viral\ncause.1 Most of these outbreaks involve enteric, i.e., fecal-oral agents. These are\norganisms that employees were shedding in their stools at the time the food was\nprepared. Because of poor or nonexistent handwashing procedures, workers spread\nthese organisms to the food. In addition, infected cuts, burns, or boils on hands can\nalso result in contamination of food. Viral, bacterial, and parasitic agents can be\ninvolved.\nTraditionally, food regulations have required two methods of preventing the spread of\nfoodborne disease by this mode of transfer, i.e., they have prohibited food workers from\npreparing food when they are infectious and have required thorough and frequent\nhandwashing. In order to strengthen fecal-oral transmission interventions, the Food\nCode provides focused and specific guidance about ill workers and when handwashing\nmust occur. As a final barrier, bare-hand contact with ready-to-eat food (i.e., food that is\nedible without washing or is not subsequently subjected to a pathogen kill step) is\nprohibited and suitable utensils such as spatulas, tongs, single-use gloves, or\ndispensing equipment are required to be used.\nBased on CDC Summary Surveillance for Foodborne-Disease Outbreaks \u2013 United States, 1988-1992 and New York\nState Department of Health data 1980-1991 published: Weingold, Guzewich, Fudala, 1994, Use of Foodborne\nDisease Data for HACCP Risk Assessment.

An exception is\npermitting the storage and display of frozen, commercially packaged raw animal food\nadjacent to or above frozen, commercially packaged ready-to-eat food. The freezer\nequipment should be designed and maintained to keep foods in the frozen state.\nCorrective action should be taken if the storage or display unit loses power or otherwise\nfails. Raw or ready-to-eat foods or commercially processed bulk-pack food that is\npackaged on-site presents a greater risk of cross-contamination. Additional product\nhandling, drippage during the freezing process, partial thawing or incomplete seals on\nthe package increase the risk of cross-contamination from these products packaged inhouse.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\n\nWith regard to the storage of different types of raw animal foods as specified under\nsubparagraph 3-302.11(A)(2), it is the intent of this Code to require separation based\non anticipated microbial load and raw animal food type (species). Separating different\ntypes of raw animal foods from one another during storage, preparation, holding and\ndisplay will prevent cross-contamination from one to the other. The required separation\nis based on a succession of cooking temperatures as specified under \u00a7 3-401.11 which\nare based on thermal destruction data and anticipated microbial load. For example, to\nprevent cross-contamination, fish and pork, which are required to be cooked to an\ninternal temperature of 145\u00b0F for 15 seconds, shall be stored above or away from raw\npoultry, which is required to be cooked to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F for 15\nseconds due to its considerably higher anticipated microbial load. In addition, raw\nanimal foods having the same cooking temperature, such as pork and fish, shall be\nseparated from one another during storage and preparation by maintaining adequate\nspacing or by placing the food in separate containers because of the potential for\nallergen cross-contamination or economic adulteration via inadvertent species\nsubstitution.\nFood that is inadequately packaged or contained in damaged packaging could become\ncontaminated by microbes, dust, or chemicals introduced by products or equipment\nstored in close proximity or by persons delivering, stocking, or opening packages or\noverwraps. Packaging must be appropriate for preventing the entry of microbes and\nother contaminants such as chemicals. These contaminants may be present on the\noutside of containers and may contaminate food if the packaging is inadequate or\ndamaged, or when the packaging is opened. The removal of food product overwraps\nmay also damage the package integrity of foods under the overwraps if proper care is\nnot taken.",

    "content": "3-302.15 Washing Fruits and Vegetables.\nPathogenic microorganisms, such as Salmonella spp., and chemicals such as\npesticides, may be present on the exterior surfaces of raw fruits and vegetables. It has\nbeen assumed that washing removes the majority of organisms and/or chemicals\npresent; however, more recent studies have demonstrated washing to fall short of their\ncomplete removal. Biofilm development by Salmonella allows bacterial cells to survive\nunder adverse environmental conditions and also reduces the ability to remove\npathogens by washing, even with antimicrobial agents. All fresh produce, except\ncommercially washed, pre-cut, and bagged produce, must be thoroughly washed under\nrunning, potable water or with chemicals as specified in Section 7-204.12, or both,\nbefore eating, cutting or cooking. Even if you plan to peel or otherwise alter the form of\nthe produce, it is still important to remove soil and debris first.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nInfiltration of microorganisms can occur through stem scars, cracks, cuts or bruises in\ncertain fruits and vegetables during washing. Once internalized, bacterial pathogens\ncannot be removed by further washing or the use of sanitizing solutions. To reduce the\nlikelihood of infiltration, wash water temperature should be maintained at 10\u00b0F warmer\nthan the pulp temperature of any produce being washed. Because certain fruits and\nvegetables are susceptible to infiltration of microorganisms during soaking or\nsubmersion, it is recommended that soaking or submerging produce during cleaning be\navoided. It is important to follow practices that minimize pathogens in the water or on\nthe surface of produce. It is important that proper handwashing procedures are\nfollowed, in accordance with Section 2-301.12 Cleaning Procedure, before and after\nhandling fresh produce.\nScrubbing with a clean brush is only recommended for produce with a tough rind or\npeel, such as carrots, cucumbers or citrus fruits that will not be bruised easily or\npenetrated by brush bristles. Scrubbing firm produce with a clean produce brush and\ndrying with a clean cloth towel or fresh disposable towel can further reduce bacteria that\nmay be present. Washing fresh fruits and vegetables with soap, detergent or other\nsurfactants should be avoided as they facilitate infiltration and may not be approved for\nuse on food. Toxic or undesirable residues could be present in or on the food if\nchemicals used for washing purposes are unapproved or applied in excessive\nconcentrations. Unless otherwise stipulated in 21 CFR 173.315, chemicals used to\nwash or peel fruits and vegetables should not exceed the minimum amount required to\naccomplish the intended effect, need to be accurately tested for proper concentration,\nand must adhere to any indications as dictated on the product label.\nMany pre-cut, bagged produce items are pre-washed. If so, these products will be\nidentified as such on the package label, and can be used as ready-to-eat without further\nwashing. The label should also state if further washing is recommended or necessary.\nPrecut or prewashed produce in open bags should not be washed before use. After\nbeing cut, certain produce such as melons, leafy greens and tomatoes are considered\ntime/temperature control for safety food (TCS) requiring time/temperature control for\nsafety and should be refrigerated at 41\u00b0F or lower to prevent any pathogens that may\nbe present from multiplying. For more retail food guidance on the storage and handling\nof tomatoes, leafy greens, and other produce, you may consult the FDA Program\nInformation Manual, Retail Food Protection Storage and Handling of Tomatoes, dated\n2007-10-05, available at\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/IndustryandRegulat\noryAssistanceandTrainingResources/ucm113843.htm, the document, Time as a Public\nHealth Control for Cut Tomatoes, dated 2010-06-08 available at\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/IndustryandRegulat\noryAssistanceandTrainingResources/ucm215053.htm\nand the FDA Program Information Manual, Recommendations for the Temperature\nControl of Cut Leafy Greens during Storage and Display in Retail Food Establishments\ndated 2010-07-07 available at\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/IndustryandRegulat\noryAssistanceandTrainingResources/ucm218750.htm\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nOn 1998-10-26 a voluntary guidance document for the produce industry which\naddresses microbial hazards and good agricultural and management practices\ncommonly used by fresh fruit and vegetable producers was issued jointly by FDA,\nUSDA, and CDC.

For example, ice used to store or display fish or\npackaged foods could become contaminated with microbes present on the fish or\npackaging. If this ice is then used as a food ingredient, it could contaminate the final\nproduct.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\n3-303.12.

This\nmay also result in the addition of water to the food that is unclaimed in the food's\nformulation and label.\nUnpackaged foods such as fresh fish are often stored and/or displayed on ice. A\npotential for increasing the microbial load of a food exists because, as the ice melts,\npathogens from one food may be carried by water to other foods. The potential for\ncontamination is reduced by continuous draining of melting ice.\nPreventing\nContamination\nFrom Equipment,\nUtensils, and\nLinens\n\n\n3-304.11. Food Contact with Equipment and Utensils\n\n\n3-304.11 Food Contact with Equipment and Utensils.\nPathogens can be transferred to food from utensils that have been stored on surfaces\nwhich have not been cleaned and sanitized. They may also be passed on by\nconsumers or employees directly, or indirectly from used tableware or food containers.\nSome pathogenic microorganisms survive outside the body for considerable periods of\ntime. Food that comes into contact directly or indirectly with surfaces that are not clean\nand sanitized is liable to such contamination. The handles of utensils, even if\nmanipulated with gloved hands, are particularly susceptible to contamination.\nProbe-type price or identification tags are defined as a utensil. This means that if such\ntags are for multiuse, they must meet the criteria listed in Parts 4-1 Materials for\nConstruction and Repair, and 4-2 Design and Construction. Probe-type price or product\nidentification tags can cause microbial, chemical, or physical contamination if not\nproperly designed, constructed, and maintained.\nThe Food Code defines gloves as a \"utensil\" and therefore gloves must meet the\napplicable requirements related to utensil construction, cleaning, and storage.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\n3-304.12. In-Use Utensils, Between-Use Storage\n\n\n3-304.12 In-Use Utensils, Between-Use Storage.\nRefer to the public health reason for \u00a7 3-304.\n\n11. Once a food employee begins to use a utensil such as a ladle, spatula, or knife, that\nhas been previously cleaned and sanitized, it is then considered an in-use utensil. Inuse utensils, used on a continuous or intermittent basis during preparation or\ndispensing, must be cleaned and sanitized on a schedule that precludes the growth of\npathogens that may have been introduced onto utensil surfaces. In-use utensils may\nbe safely stored in hot water maintained at 135o\nF or above during intermittent use\nbecause microbial growth is controlled at such temperatures.\nA food utensil should be designed and used to prevent bare hand contact with ready-toeat food or to minimize contact with food that is not in a ready-to-eat form. On-site\nevaluations can be made to determine if a utensil is improperly designed for the task or\nwhether a food employee is misusing an appropriately designed utensil.",

Any wiping cloths that are not dry (except\nthose used once and then laundered) must be stored in a sanitizer solution of adequate\nconcentration between uses. Wiping cloths soiled with organic material can overcome\nthe effectiveness of, and neutralize, the sanitizer. The sanitizing solution must be\nchanged as needed to minimize the accumulation of organic material and sustain\nproper concentration. Proper sanitizer concentration should be ensured by checking\nthe solution periodically with an appropriate chemical test kit.\nWiping down a surface with a reusable wet cloth that has been properly stored in a\nsanitizer solution is an acceptable practice for wiping up certain types of food spills and\nwiping down equipment surfaces. However, this practice does not constitute cleaning\nand sanitizing of food contact surfaces where and when such is required to satisfy the\nmethods and frequency requirements in Parts 4-6 and 4-7 of the Food Code.\nThe same is true of the practice of wiping down a surface using dry disposable towels\nand a spray bottle containing pre-mixed sanitizing solution. This practice is not\nprohibited, however it alone does not constitute proper cleaning and sanitizing of food\ncontact surfaces where and when such is required to satisfy the methods and frequency\nrequirements in Parts 4-6 and 4-7 of the Food Code.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\n\nFurther, for the purpose of wiping up food spills from surfaces in situations where full\ncleaning and sanitizing is not required (such as when a soft drink overflows onto the\nside of a cup or onto a countertop) the use of dry cloths and disposable towels is also\nacceptable as long as the cloth or towel is used for no other purpose. Again, this does\nnot constitute a proper cleaning and sanitizing procedure for a food contact surface,\nwhen such is called for in 4-6 and 4-7 of the Food Code.\nIn order to effectively clean and sanitize food contact surfaces, where and when\nrequired to satisfy the requirements in Parts 4-6 and 4-7 of the Food Code, the surface\nmust be first cleaned properly to remove organic material. In most cases this requires\nuse of detergents or other cleaners such as described in Section 4-603.14 of the Food\nCode. After the surface is clean to sight and touch, a sanitizing solution of adequate\ntemperature with the correct chemical concentration should then be applied to the\nsurface. The sanitizing solution must stay on the surface for a specific contact time as\nspecified in this Code and in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s EPA-registered label,\nas applicable.",

Gloves used in touching ready-to-eat food are defined as a \"utensil\" and must meet the\napplicable requirements related to utensil construction, good repair, cleaning, and\nstorage.\nMultiuse gloves, especially when used repeatedly and soiled, can become breeding\ngrounds for pathogens that could be transferred to food. Soiled gloves can directly\ncontaminate food if stored with ready-to-eat food or may indirectly contaminate food if\nstored with articles that will be used in contact with food. Multiuse gloves must be\nwashed, rinsed, and sanitized between activities that contaminate the gloves. Hands\nmust be washed before donning gloves. Gloves must be discarded when soil or other\ncontaminants enter the inside of the glove.\nSlash-resistant gloves are not easily cleaned and sanitized. Their use with ready-to-eat\nfoods could contaminate the food.\nNatural Rubber Latex (NRL) Gloves\nNatural rubber latex gloves have been reported to cause allergic reactions in some\nindividuals who wear latex gloves during food preparation, and even in individuals\neating food prepared by food employees wearing latex gloves (refer to Annex 2,\n3-304.15). This information should be taken into consideration when deciding whether\nsingle-use gloves made of latex will be used during food preparation.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\n\nAlthough many allergic reactions occur as a result of occupational exposure, CFSAN is\nactively reviewing its current policy on the use of disposable NRL gloves in food\noperations in light of the possible transmission of the latex protein via food. To gain\nadditional information regarding allergic reactions allegedly due to the ingestion of food\ncontaminated by NRL in retail settings, CFSAN has been collecting reports of such\nreactions from consumers who have contacted the Agency. Several offices within\nCFSAN will continue to collaborate in reviewing incoming data. The results of these\nactivities and other related efforts will be used to determine if policy changes regarding\nthe use of latex in food operations, based on food safety considerations, are warranted.\nThe FDA, Office of Food Additive Safety, Division of Food Contact Notification, reviews\ngloves submitted for food-contact use in the food industry on the basis of the glove\u2019s\nformulation or components. FDA regulates NRL gloves used for medical purposes only.\nFDA is aware of the following information related to occupational hazards (not food\nsafety hazards) associated with the use of NRL gloves:\n\u2022\t The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) published a 1997\nAlert titled \"Preventing Allergic Reactions to Natural Rubber Latex in the Workplace\"\n(NIOSH publication number 97-135) which is found at\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/97-135/.\n\u2022\t The American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) and the\nAmerican Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) issued a joint\nstatement discouraging the routine use of NRL gloves by food handlers.

These containers are likely to be soiled when the consumer returns the\ncontainer to the food establishment. As a result, pathogens may be transferred to food\nby consumers or employees directly, or indirectly, from used take-home food\ncontainers. The existing provisions in the Food Code, specifically the cleaning and\nsanitization provisions in Parts 4-6 and 4-7, if carried out properly upon return of a used\ncontainer, are sufficient to ensure that the container is safe to refill or reuse if performed\nin conjunction with a visual inspection by a food employee to verify that the container\nstill meets the intent of the provisions in Parts 4-1 and 4-2. Reusing single-service and\nsingle-use articles is prohibited by the Food Code.\nThe refilling of consumer-owned, personal take-out beverage containers, such as\nthermally insulated bottles, nonspill coffee cups, and promotional beverage glasses, by\na consumer or food employee introduces the possibility of contamination of the filling\nequipment or product by improperly cleaned containers or the improper operation of the\nequipment. To prevent this contamination and possible health hazards to the consumer,\nthe refilling of consumer-owned, personal take-out beverage containers is limited to\nbeverages that are not potentially hazardous (time/temperature control for safety)\nfoods.

These include the anticipated level of pathogenic bacteria in the raw product,\nthe initial temperature of the food, and the food's bulk which affects the time to achieve\nthe needed internal product temperature. Other factors to be considered include postcooking heat rise and the time the food must be held at a specified internal\ntemperature.\nGreater numbers and varieties of pathogens generally are found on poultry than on\nother raw animal foods. Therefore, a higher temperature, in combination with the\nappropriate time is needed to cook these products.\nTo kill microorganisms, food must be held at a sufficient temperature for the specified\ntime. Cooking is a scheduled process in which each of a series of continuous\ntime/temperature combinations can be equally effective. For example, in cooking a\nbeef roast, the microbial lethality achieved at 112 minutes after it has reached 54.4\u00b0C\n(130\u00b0F) is the same lethality attained as if it were cooked for 4 minutes after it has\nreached 62.8\u00b0C (145\u00b0F). Cooked beef and roast beef, including sectioned and formed\nroasts, chunked and formed roasts, lamb roasts and cooked corned beef can be\nprepared using one of the time and temperature combinations listed in the chart in\n\u00a7 3-401.11 to meet a 6.5-log10 reduction of Salmonella. The stated temperature is the\nminimum that must be achieved and maintained in all parts of each piece of meat for a\nleast the stated time. The source of the time and temperature parameters is from the\nUSDA/FSIS Appendix A. Compliance Guidelines For Meeting Lethality Performance\nStandards For Certain Meat And Poultry Products found at\nhttp://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/regulatory-compliance/complianceguides-index/compliance-guides-index.\nCooking requirements are based in part on the biology of pathogens. The thermal\ndestruction of a microorganism is determined by its ability to survive heat. Different\nspecies of microorganisms have different susceptibilities to heat. Also, the growing\nstage of a species (such as the vegetative cell of bacteria, the trophozoite of protozoa,\nor the larval form of worms) is less resistant than the same organism's survival form\n(the bacterial spore, protozoan cyst, or worm egg).\nFood characteristics also affect the lethality of cooking temperatures. Heat penetrates\ninto different foods at different rates. High fat content in food reduces the effective\nlethality of heat. High humidity within the cooking vessel and the moisture content of\nfood aid thermal destruction.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nHeating a large roast too quickly with a high oven temperature may char or dry the\noutside, creating a layer of insulation that shields the inside from efficient heat\npenetration. To kill all pathogens in food, cooking must bring all parts of the food up to\nthe required temperatures for the correct length of time.\nThe temperature and time combination criteria specified in Part 3-4 of this Code are\nbased on the destruction of Salmonellae. This organism, if present in raw shell eggs, is\ngenerally found in relatively low numbers. Other foods, uncomminuted fish and meats\nincluding commercially raised game animal meat, specified as acceptable for cooking at\nthis temperature and time parameter are expected to have a low level of internal\ncontamination. The parameters are expected to provide destruction of the surface\ncontaminants on these foods. Part 3-4 includes temperature and time parameters that\nprovide \"D\" values (decimal log reduction values) that may surpass 7D. For example, at\n63o\nC(145o\nF), a time span of 15 seconds will provide a 3D reduction of Salmonella\nEnteritidis in eggs.\nThe requirements specified under \u00b6 3-401.11(D) acknowledge the rights of an informed\nconsumer to order and consume foods as preferred by that consumer based on the\nconsumer\u2019s health status and understanding of the risks associated with eating raw or\npartially-cooked animal foods.\nIn consumer self-service operations, such as buffets, salad bars, sushi bars, or display\ncases, the consumer advisory as specified under section 3-603.11 must be posted or\navailable at the self-service unit where the raw or partially cooked food is held for\nservice and readily accessible to consumers prior to making their food selections. In a\ncatered situation, such as a wedding reception, guests are responsible for making their\nown requests or selections.\nSlow-cooked roasts - Heating Deviations and Slow Come Up Time\n(Source: USDA/FSIS Appendix A Compliance Guidelines For Meeting Lethality\nPerformance Standards For Certain Meat And Poultry Products found at\nhttp://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/regulatory-compliance/complianceguides-index/compliance-guides-index.\nHeating deviations, which most often involve slow come-up time or an inordinate dwell\ntime within the optimum temperature range for microorganism growth can foster the\nmultiplication of many pathogens. This multiplication sometimes can be so prodigious\nthat even recooking may be ineffective in rendering the product safe. Also, certain\ntoxigenic bacteria can release toxins into the product. Some of these toxins, such as\nthose of Staphylococcus aureus, are extremely heat stable and are not inactivated by\nnormal recooking temperatures.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines",

Heating deviations can\nfavor the multiplication of many types of bacteria. It would be difficult and expensive to\nsample for all of them. Depending on the circumstances, establishments may want to\nuse computer modeling to estimate the relative multiplication of bacteria. For example,\nin a past incident involving an extreme heating deviation, product was put in an oven in\nwhich the temperature was inadvertently set to 95\u00b0F for about 12 hours. Computer\nmodeling was easily applied in this case because much of the dwell time was at one\ntemperature. The USDA/FSIS determined that within a 6-hour time frame (with other\ngrowth conditions assumed to be favorable), the relative multiplication of many\npathogens of concern could have exceeded 5-logs. Clearly the product could not be\nsalvaged by reprocessing and was therefore destroyed. Under changing conditions of\ntemperature, however, computer modeling becomes more difficult. One approach is to\naverage lag/log times over small increments such as 5\u00b0 and add these times to get an\napproximation of possible total relative growth over a larger increment of time.\nEstablishments must keep in mind that the population of bacteria before processing is\ngenerally unknown and that assumptions in the high range often are used as input\nparameters in the modeling.\nSeared Steak\nThe provision for allowing seared steaks was reviewed by the National Advisory\nCommittee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF) and USDA. Paragraph\n3-401.11(C) includes their recommendations.\nUSDA comments included, \u201cFor the purposes of this discussion, steak is a whole beef\nmuscle. It does not include whole beef muscle that has been pinned, injected, or\nchopped and formed. It may be cut cross grain, such as sirloin, chuck, or porterhouse;\nor it may be cut with the grain, such as flank, skirt, or Chateaubriand. Other species,\nsuch as poultry, pork, and lamb are not included.\u201d\nNACMCF comments included, \u201cDue to the low probability of pathogenic organisms\nbeing present in or migrating from the external surface to the interior of beef muscle,\ncuts of intact muscle (steaks) should be safe if the external surfaces are exposed to\ntemperatures sufficient to effect a cooked color change. In addition, the cut (exposed)\nsurfaces must receive additional heat to effect a complete sear across the cut surfaces.\nGrill or char marks may be applied to the complete surface searing. The meat should\nbe seared on both top and bottom surfaces utilizing a heating environment (e.g., grill or\nbroiling oven) that imparts a temperature at the surface of the intact steak of at least\n145o\nF to achieve a cooked color change on all external surfaces. The searing of all\nsurfaces should be continuous until the desired degree of doneness and appearance\nare attained. This is considered a ready-to-eat food.\u201d\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nAs reflected in the definition of \u201cwhole-muscle, intact beef steak,\u201d marination is a food\nsafety concern when the fascia (exterior surface) of the steak is broken by scoring or\nother means which allows the marinade to penetrate, and potentially contaminate, the\ninterior of the steak. In such cases, the Code allowance for undercooking without a\nconsumer advisory is negated.\nPork\nIn pork, Trichinella spiralis, Toxoplasma gondii, and Taenia solium, parasites\ncausing foodborne illness, are inactivated at temperatures below 145o\nF. Therefore,\npork roasts can be cooked like beef roasts (e.g., 145o\nF for 3 minutes) and pork chops\ncooked like steaks to achieve an internal temperature of 145o\nF for 15 seconds.\nBased on the Goodfellow and Brown study, a 5D reduction of organisms is achieved at\n68o\nC (155o\nF) for 15 seconds for the following foods: ratites and injected meats and\ncomminuted: fish, meat, game animals commercially raised for food, and game\nanimals that come under a USDA voluntary inspection program. Ratites such as\nostrich, emu, and rhea are included in this list of raw animals foods because when\ncooked to a temperature greater than 68o\nC (155o\nF), ratites exhibit a (metallic) \"off\"\ntaste.\nWhen USDA established the time and temperature parameters for 9 CFR 318.23 HeatProcessing and Stabilization Requirements for Uncurred Meat Patties (known as the\n\"patty rule\"), the Agency based the 5D for Salmonella on extrapolations applied to the\nresearch done by Goodfellow and Brown to account for the lack of a \"come up, come\ndown\" time in the thin, small mass beef patties. Consequently, there is no linear\nrelationship between the patty rule and roast beef time and temperature parameters.\nThe patty rule also provided for an 8D reduction in the number of Shiga toxin-producing\nEscherichia coli. The time and temperature requirements in the Food Code for\ncomminuted meats are comparable to the USDA requirements.\nTemperature for Comminuted Meat at Less Than 1 Second\nIn the \"Report of the Task Force on Technical Issues Arising from the National Advisory\nCommittee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods\u201d (NACMCF) Review of the Meat Patty\nProposal\" (undated), it is stated on page 7, in Option (A), that:\n\u201cBased on the 1998 research data ... and an assumption that\ninstantaneous is defined as eight seconds, manufacturers would be\nrequired to process fully-cooked meat patties at a temperature of 157o\nF.\nGiven the lack of any significant margin of safety in this process, there\nshould be no deviation below the 158o\nF requirement.\u201d\nIn November, 1997, the NACMCF Meat and Poultry Subcommittee revisited the time\nand temperatures for cooking hamburger and advised FDA that cooking hamburger to\n158o\nF for less than one second is an adequate cook based on the following:\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n1. The cooking recommendations contained in the Food Code and in\nUSDA guidance provide a large margin of safety for killing vegetative\nenteric pathogens;\n\n2. The concept of integrated lethality (the kill imparted during the entire\nheating and cooling process) adds to the margin of safety; and\n3. The time component of the time and temperature requirement will be\nexceeded before the temperature can be determined.\nThe parameters for cooking poultry, wild game animal meats, stuffed food products,\netc., of 74o\nC (165o\nF) or above for 15 seconds yield greater than a 7D reduction.\nChildren\u2019s Menu\nThe 2005 FDA Food Code Section 3-401.11 (D) \u201cRaw Animal Foods\u201d allows operators\nto serve raw or partially cooked animal food items on their customer\u2019s request, as long\nas the establishment does not serve a \u201cHighly Susceptible Population\u201d and the\ncustomer is informed of the risks associated with consuming undercooked items.\nThe definition of \u201cHighly Susceptible Population\u201d however, only includes young children\nwho are of pre-school age and who obtain food under custodial care (as from a child\ndaycare center).

Microwave Cooking\n\n3-401.12 Microwave Cooking.\nThe rapid increase in food temperature resulting from microwave heating does not\nprovide the same cumulative time and temperature relationship necessary for the\ndestruction of microorganisms as do conventional cooking methods. In order to\nachieve comparable lethality, the food must attain a temperature of 74o\nC (165o\nF) in all\nparts of the food. Since cold spots may exist in food cooking in a microwave oven, it is\ncritical to measure the food temperature at multiple sites when the food is removed\nfrom the oven and then allow the food to stand covered for two minutes post microwave\nheating to allow thermal equalization and exposure. Although some microwave ovens\nare designed and engineered to deliver energy more evenly to the food than others, the\nimportant factor is to measure and ensure that the final temperature reaches 74o\nC\n(165o\nF) throughout the food.\n\"The factors that influence microwave thermal processes include many of the same\nfactors that are important in conventional processes (mass of objects, shape of objects,\nspecific heat and thermal conductivity, etc.).

Section\n3-401.14 requires that establishments wishing to use a non-continuous process for the\ncooking of raw animal foods establish and follow a written plan that ensures each stage\nof the process is completed within time and temperature parameters that adequately\nprevent pathogen survival and growth. Section 3-401.14 also requires that\nestablishments take special precautions to ensure that raw animal foods that have only\nbeen initially heated to temperatures that are not lethal to the pathogens of concern are\nclearly identified so that they will not be inadvertently sold or served to the consumer in\na partially cooked state.\nTo ensure the food does not dwell for extended periods within temperature ranges that\nfavor pathogen growth, \u00a7 3-401.14 establishes limits on the time permitted to initially\nheat the food (initial \u201ccome-up\u201d time) and the time permitted to cool the product to\ntemperatures that are safe for refrigerated storage. Together, these limits should\nprevent food from remaining at temperatures at which pathogen growth to harmful\nlevels may occur.\nThe criteria in \u00a7 3-401.14 were developed with consideration of the United States\nDepartment of Agriculture/Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS)\nPerformance Standards for Partially Cooked and Char-Marked Meat Patties and\nPartially Cooked Poultry Breakfast Strips found in 9 CFR 318.23 and 9 CFR 381.\n\n150.

It is intended to limit the cumulative\ngrowth of Clostridium perfringens that may occur during the come-up time and the\nsubsequent cooling of the product in accordance with the requirements in\n\u00b6 3-501.14(A). Unless properly controlled, processes in which animal foods are heated\nto sub-lethal temperatures and times and then cooled may create an environment for\nthe growth of Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum and other spore\nforming, toxigenic bacteria.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nThe product temperature achieved during the initial heating process may not be\nsufficient to destroy vegetative cells of Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium\nperfringens, and Bacillus cereus, if present. The concern is the generation of a large\nnumber of vegetative cells of Clostridium perfringens and/or Clostridium botulinum\nbefore the final cooking stage. For Clostridium botulinum, if enough vegetative cells\nare produced, toxigenesis can occur in the product before the product is fully cooked.\nThe toxin is not destroyed at the minimum required cooking temperatures. For\nClostridium perfringens, if a large number of vegetative cells are consumed, illness\ncan result. In either case a high number of vegetative cells may challenge the lethality\nstep of the ultimate cooking process to the extent that it will be unable to completely\neliminate all of these vegetative cells. The cumulative growth of these bacterial\npathogens must be taken into account during both the initial heating and cooling steps.\nThe hazard may be compounded with an extended initial \u201ccome-up\u201d time and/or a\nprolonged cooling stage. Hence the degree of hazard may be dependent upon the\nultimate effect of the initial heating and cooling, as well as the final cooking step.\nA full and adequate cook during the final cooking step is of critical importance to ensure\ndestruction of any pathogens that may have survived and proliferated during any initial\nheating and cooling stages of the non-continuous cooking process. Section 3-401.14\nrequires that animal foods cooked by a non-continuous cooking process achieve a\nminimum final cook temperature that heats all parts of the food to a temperature and for\na time specified under \u00b6\u00b63-401.11 (A)-(C). This requirement also precludes serving\nanimal foods that have undergone non-continuous cooking in an undercooked or raw\nstate. In other words, animal foods cooked using a non-continuous process are not\ncovered in the exceptions provided for in \u00b6 3-401.11(D) that allow for serving\nundercooked animal foods upon consumer request and with an adequate consumer\nadvisory.\nSection 3-401.14 requires that an establishment using non-continuous cooking\nprocesses also establish procedures for identifying foods that have only been partially\ncooked and cooled. This is necessary to ensure these foods are not mistaken by food\nworkers for foods that have been fully cooked and therefore ready-to-eat without a full\ncook. Partially cooked foods may appear to be fully cooked.\nRequiring that food establishments obtain prior approval by the regulatory authority\nbefore employing non-continuous cooking processes will help to ensure that the\nestablishment has the proper procedures in place, as well as the necessary facilities\nand capacity to monitor the appropriate cooling, cooking, separation and product\nidentification of the foods. in accordance with the requirements.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nFreezing 3-402.11 Parasite Destruction.\nRefer to the public health reason for \u00a7 3-201.",

Proper reheating provides a major\ndegree of assurance that pathogens will be eliminated. It is especially effective in\nreducing the numbers of Clostridium perfringens that may grow in meat, poultry, or\ngravy if these products were improperly cooled. Vegetative cells of C. perfringens can\ncause foodborne illness when they grow to high numbers. Highly resistant\nC. perfringens spores will survive cooking and hot holding. If food is abused by being\nheld at improper holding temperatures or improperly cooled, spores can germinate to\nbecome rapidly multiplying vegetative cells.\nAlthough proper reheating will kill most organisms of concern, some toxins such as that\nproduced by Staphylococcus aureus, cannot be inactivated through reheating of the\nfood. It is imperative that food contamination be minimized to avoid this risk.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\n\nThe potential for growth of pathogenic bacteria is greater in reheated cooked foods than\nin raw foods. This is because spoilage bacteria, which inhibit the growth of pathogens\nby competition on raw product, are killed during cooking. Subsequent recontamination\nwill allow pathogens to grow without competition if temperature abuse occurs.\nShelf-stable, commercially prepared ready-to eat foods in hermetically sealed\ncontainers will have received a controlled retort process that destroys all bacterial\npathogens, both vegetative cells and spores, to provide a commercially sterile product.\nRefrigerated, commercially processed, ready-to-eat, TCS food will have received\ncontrolled thermal processing that destroys vegetative bacterial cells and a controlled\ncooling process that prevents the germination of any spores present. Packaging\nprevents recontamination and refrigeration prevents spore germination. Because there\nis limited risk of contamination in these types of products, reheating such foods to the\nminimum hot holding temperature of 135\u00b0F is considered adequate when reheating for\nhot holding. This should be the case for product that remains in the container or\npackage after it is opened, provided the proper steps are taken to protect the remaining\nportions from contamination and they are maintained at the appropriate cold holding\ntemperatures as specified in the Food Code.\nRefer also to the public health reason for \u00a7 3-401.12.",

    "content": "3-501.14 Cooling.\nSafe cooling requires removing heat from food quickly enough to prevent microbial\ngrowth. Excessive time for cooling of time/temperature control for safety foods has\nbeen consistently identified as one of the leading contributing factors to foodborne\nillness. During slow cooling, time/temperature control for safety foods are subject to the\ngrowth of a variety of pathogenic microorganisms. A longer time near ideal bacterial\nincubation temperatures, 21o\nC - 52o\nC (70o\nF - 125o\nF), is to be avoided. If the food is not\ncooled in accordance with this Code requirement, pathogens may grow to sufficient\nnumbers to cause foodborne illness.\nThe Food Code provision for cooling provides for cooling from 135\u00baF to 41\u00b0F or 45\u00b0F in\n6 hours, with cooling from 135\u00baF to 70\u00b0F in 2 hours. The 6-hour cooling parameter, with\nan initial 2-hour rapid cool, allows for greater flexibility in meeting the Code. The initial\n2-hour cool is a critical element of this cooling process. An example of proper cooling\nmight involve cooling from 135\u00baF to 70\u00baF in 1 hour, in which case 5 hours remain for\ncooling from 70\u00baF to 41\u00baF or 45\u00baF. Conversely, if cooling from 135\u00baF to 41\u00b0F or 45\u00b0F is\nachieved in 6 hours, but the initial cooling to 70\u00baF took 3 hours, the food safety hazards\nmay not be adequately controlled.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nIf the cooking step prior to cooling is adequate and no recontamination occurs, all but\nthe spore-forming organisms such as Clostridium perfringens or Bacillus cereus\nshould be killed or inactivated. However, under substandard sanitary conditions, other\npathogens such as Salmonella or Listeria monocytogenes may be reintroduced.\nThus, cooling requirements are based on growth characteristics of organisms that may\nsurvive or be a post-cook contaminate and grow rapidly under temperature abuse\nconditions.\nShell Eggs\nFDA has approved the use of ionizing radiation for shell eggs. This approval means\nthat FDA has not found the ionizing radiation process to be unsafe for shell eggs.\nHowever, shell eggs that have been subjected to the approved ionizing radiation\nprocess are not considered to have been pasteurized. Shell egg pasteurization\nrequires the egg to have been subjected to a 5-log kill process for Salmonella\nEnteritidis, while the approved ionizing radiation process may deliver only 2 or 3 logs\nreduction. Therefore, eggs treated by ionizing radiation process alone must be held\nunder refrigeration, as it cannot be guaranteed that Salmonella Enteritidis will be\neliminated in all treated eggs. Further, irradiated eggs must be labeled in accordance\nwith 21 CFR 179.26 Ionizing radiation for the treatment of food.\nHard-boiled eggs with shell intact may be cooled in ambient air and are not considered\nto be a time/temperature control for safety food after cooling. Hard-boiled eggs may be\ncooled in drinking water but are considered to be a time/temperature control for safety\nfood after cooling because pathogens, which may be present in the water, may pass\nthrough the egg shell during cooling.\nSalmonella Enteritidis has been shown to have an extended lag phase in shell eggs\ndue to inhibitory characteristics of the albumen. Research indicates that the organisms\nare physically located near the exterior of the yolk membrane, in contact with the\nbacteriostatic components. Growth does not appear until the yolk membrane is\nweakened by age or physically breached and the yolk nutrients, such as iron, become\navailable to the organisms.\nFederal regulations effective 1999-08-27, require shell eggs to be transported and\ndistributed under refrigeration at an ambient temperature not to exceed 45\u00b0F. Packed\nshell eggs must be labeled indicating that refrigeration is required. Imported shell eggs\npacked for consumer use are required to include a certification that the eggs, at all\ntimes after packing, have been stored and transported at an ambient temperature of no\ngreater than 45\u00b0F.\nOn 2000-12-05 federal regulations were amended to require that shell egg\ncartons bear safe handling instructions and be placed under refrigeration at 45\u00b0F or\nlower upon delivery at retail establishments (65 FR 76091, 2000-12-05, Food\nLabeling, Safe Handling Statements, Labeling of Shell Eggs; Refrigeration of Shell\nEggs Held for Retail Distribution). The amended provisions include:\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\u2022\t 21 CFR Part 16 Regulatory Hearing before the Food and Drug Administration,\n\u00a7 16.5 Inappplicability and limited applicability, (4) A hearing on an order for relabeling, diversion or destruction of shell eggs\u2026\n\u2022\t 21 CFR Part 101 Food Labeling \u00a7 101.17 Food labeling warning, notice, and\nsafe handling statements, (h) Shell eggs.\n\u2022\t 21 CFR Part 115 Shell Eggs, \u00a7 115.50 Refrigeration of shell eggs held for retail\ndistribution.\nShell eggs must be placed immediately after receipt in refrigerated equipment that is\ncapable of maintaining an ambient air temperature of 45\u00b0F. With the newly established\nFederal requirement for eggs to be in an ambient storage and transportation\ntemperature of 45\u00b0F, and with refrigeration of eggs at retail as described above, the\noverall time that eggs are stored at temperatures that allow the growth of Salmonella\nspp. should be shortened. Additionally, this requirement negates the need to \"cool\"\nshell eggs upon receipt, although food establishment operators should maximize the\ncirculation of cooled air in refrigeration units by separating flats, cases, and multiple\ncartons of eggs.\nCFSAN/FSIS Joint Position Paper on Cooling\nThe processing of most ready-to-eat products includes a heat treatment or cooking step\nto eliminate pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms. However, this heat treatment\ndoes not eliminate spores of Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium perfringens\nand other spore-forming bacteria. Furthermore, these organisms can thrive in the warm\nproduct since other competing organisms have been eliminated. Non-refrigerated,\nanaerobic conditions are conducive to their growth and multiplication.\nTo prevent the growth and multiplication of spore-forming organisms, product should be\ncooled rapidly after cooking. When there is inadequate cooling, spores can germinate\nand the resulting vegetative cells can multiply to hazardous levels. The presence of\nsufficient numbers of C. botulinum or other spore-forming organisms may lead to\nproduction of harmful toxins. Therefore, ensuring no growth of these organisms will\nprovide the greatest amount of safety.\nThe USDA/FSIS Performance Standards for the Production of Certain Meat and Poultry\nProducts require a stabilization step (cooling) after the lethality step. The stabilization\nrequirements allow for no growth of C. botulinum and no more than 1 log growth of\nC. perfringens. The performance standard of no more than 1 log growth of\nC. perfringens was based on the following reasons:\n\n1. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested viable counts of\n105 or greater of C. perfringens per gram as one of the criteria for incriminating\nC. perfringens as a causative agent of foodborne illness in finished product.\nHowever, foods responsible for C. perfringens outbreaks were found usually to\ncontain 106 vegetative C. perfringens cells per gram.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nIn FSIS microbiological raw product surveys, samples were found to contain more\nthan 1000 C. perfringens per gram. There is some probability that greater than\n104 C. perfringens per gram can occur in the raw product on rare occasions. It is a\nconservative assumption that the great majority of C. perfringens in the raw product\nare spores.",

If there are more than 104 C. perfringens (spores) per\ngram on raw product, it is possible that there may be more than 104 vegetative\nC. perfringens per gram in the product if it is improperly cooled after cooking.\n\n3. Based on the CDC recommended upper limit of 105 which should not be exceeded,\nit was determined that a limit of no more than 1 log10 growth of C. perfringens\nwould be appropriate to ensure that there would be no more than 105\nC. perfringens per gram on the finished product after cooling.\n\n4. The performance standard was discussed with experts on clostridia research. The\nexperts agreed that limiting the relative growth of C. perfringens to no more than\n1 log10 would be reasonable and somewhat conservative with respect to product\nsafety. (64 FR 732, 1999-01-06, Performance Standards for the Production of\nCertain Meat and Meat Products).\nThe FSIS compliance guideline for the cooling performance standards, which can be\nfound at http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/regulatorycompliance/compliance-guides-index/compliance-guides-index. Compliance Guidelines\nfor Cooling Heat-Treated Meat and Poultry Products (Stabilization), is that product must\nbe cooled from 130\u00baF to 80\u00b0F in 1.5 hours and from 80\u00baF to 40\u00b0F in 5 hours. This\ncooling rate can be applied universally to cooked products like partially cooked or fully\ncooked, intact or non-intact meat and poultry products. The guideline results in\ncontinuous and rapid cooling of the product in the temperature range where the sporeforming organisms can grow rapidly.\nThe former USDA guideline of cooling from 120\u00baF to 55\u00b0F in no more than 6 hours is\nalso included in the new compliance guidelines. In using this guideline, chilling should\nbegin within 90 minutes after the cooking cycle is completed, and cooling should\ncontinue until product reaches 40\u00b0F. The 6-hour rule begins when the product reaches\n120\u00baF, and product should not be shipped until the product reaches 40\u00b0F. This older\ncooling guideline results in a significantly smaller margin of safety, especially if the\nproduct is non-intact. In using this older guideline, the establishment has to ensure that\ncooling is as rapid as possible, especially between 120\u00baF and 80\u00b0F, and should monitor\nthe cooling closely to prevent any deviation. If product remains between these\ntemperatures for more than an hour, compliance with the performance standard is less\ncertain.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nThe FSIS cooling guideline for meat and poultry products containing 100 ppm\nadded nitrite is 130\u00baF to 80\u00b0F in 5 hours and from 80\u00baF to 45\u00b0F in 10 hours, a total of\n15 hours cooling time. This cooling process provides a narrow margin of safety. In\ncase of cooling deviations, the establishment should assume that their process has\nexceeded the performance standard for controlling the growth of C. perfringens, and\nshould take corrective action. However, the presence of nitrite should ensure\ncompliance with the performance standard for C. botulinum.\nThe Food Code provision for cooling is similar, though not identical to the FSIS cooling\ncompliance guidelines. It provides for cooling from 135\u00baF to 70\u00b0F in 2 hours and from\n135\u00baF to 41\u00b0F or 45\u00b0F in 6 hours and is based on the same food safety concerns as\nFSIS\u2019 guidance. The Food Code provides prescriptive cooling time/temperature\ncombinations without a HACCP plan in place. Federally inspected meat and poultry\nestablishments are required to implement a HACCP plan for their operations.\nThe Conference for Food Protection (CFP) at its 2000 meeting recommended that FSIS\nand FDA ask the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods\n(NACMCF) to review the data on safe cooling times for cooked, time/temperature\ncontrol for safety foods. The review would include data from a study, submitted to the\nCFP, showing that cooling of a meat product from 130\u00baF to 45\u00b0F can safely take place\nin 15 hours based on a study by V.K. Juneja, et al., 1994. According to the authors of\nthe study, continuous cooling of a meat product from 130\u00baF to 45\u00b0F in 15 hours\npermitted about 1 log growth of C. perfringens.\nIn response to the CFP recommendation, the FSIS Administrator and CFSAN agreed\nthat the data referenced in the CFP recommendation do not support a change in the\nFSIS guidance or the Food Code \u00a7 3-501.14 and considered it inadvisable to ask the\nNACMCF to undertake the task requested for several reasons:\n\n1. The study did not address growth of C. botulinum.\n\n2. The results are from a carefully controlled laboratory study in which cooling of the\nproduct was steady and continuous, conditions difficult to maintain in most\ncommercial processing or retail environments even with data loggers and other\ncontrol mechanisms in place.\n\n3. The study was done only on ground beef and may not be applicable to other meat\nand poultry or to other time/temperature control for safety foods.\nAs an alternative response, CFSAN and FSIS advised CFP that they would provide this\nwritten position paper to clarify their joint position on the cooling issues.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines",

All microorganisms have a defined temperature\nrange in which they grow, with a minimum, maximum, and optimum. An understanding\nof the interplay between time, temperature, and other intrinsic and extrinsic factors is\ncrucial to selecting the proper storage conditions for a food product. Temperature has\ndramatic impact on both the generation time of an organism and its lag period.\nWhen considering growth rate of microbial pathogens, time and temperature are\nintegral and must be considered together. Increases in storage and/or display\ntemperature will decrease the shelf life of refrigerated foods since the higher the\ntemperature, the more permissive conditions are for growth.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nThe exception for holding time/temperature control for safety food in specially designed\ndispensing equipment recognizes technology designs that maintain the safety of\naseptically-packaged fluid foods when the equipment is manufactured and operated in\nconformance with the NSF/ANSI Standard No.\n\n18. NSF/ANSI 18 was revised in 2006,\nwith FDA input, to address the storage of certain types of time/temperature for safety\nfood or beverages in dispensing equipment without temperature control. The key\ncondition for FDA allowing this exemption from 3-501.16 is that the equipment conforms\nto the requirements as specified in NSF/ANSI 18.\nExcept for raw shell eggs, control of the growth of Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is the\nbasis for the list of cold holding temperature and time combinations in paragraph\n3-501.17(A).

The\nCode provisions for cold holding focus on environmental conditions that allow 1 log of\ngrowth of Lm, and do not set an acceptable number of Lm in food. Neither do they\nimply that Lm is in the product.\nThe times and temperatures in the 1999 Food Code were based on the USDA\nPathogen Modeling Program (PMP), which is conservative in estimating how soon Lm\nbegins to grow and how fast. The PMP was based largely on observations of microbial\ngrowth in broth cultures, but some observations in specific foods were also included.\nThe PMP allows for some variation in temperature, pH, and water activity, and gives a\nconservative estimate of safe times and temperatures for holding foods. The 1999\nFood Code estimated safe times and temperatures that would allow 3 logs of growth,\nbased on the PMP.\nDuring 2000, CFSAN researched published literature and compiled a listing of the\ngrowth potential of Lm in various food commodities using real food data. Based on this\ninformation, the 1999 Food Code times and temperatures of 41\u00baF for 7 days and 45\u00baF\nfor 4 days were validated, but the underlying performance standard changed for the\ncommodities studied. The research-based, food-specific times and temperatures allow\nno more than 1 log of growth instead of the 3 log growth predicted in the PMP. This\nmore stringent performance standard of 1 log is consistent with the USDA/FSIS\nperformance standard and the fact that the infectious dose of Lm remains unknown.\nFDA concluded that the 1999 Code time/temperature criteria hold true and provide both\na greater level of safety and a more realistic basis for regulatory requirements without\ncompromising public health protection.\nIn October 2003, FDA, in cooperation with the USDA/FSIS and CDC, released the\nQuantitative Assessment of the Relative Risk to Public Health from Foodborne Listeria\nmonocytogenes Among Selected Categories of Ready-to-Eat Foods (risk assessment)\nat\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/ScienceResearch/ResearchAreas/RiskAssessment\nSafetyAssessment/UCM197329.pdf.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nThis initiative included the development of 23 separate risk assessments and analysis\nof the relative risks of serious illness and death associated with consumption of 23\ncategories of ready-to-eat foods. These categories included: seafood, produce, meats,\ndairy products, and deli salads.\nThe risk assessment identified several broad factors that affect consumer exposure to\nLm at the time of food consumption. Two of these factors, refrigerated storage\ntemperature and duration of refrigerated storage before consumption, have a direct\nbearing on cold holding time/temperature combinations used in food establishments.\nFDA continues to have concerns about the potential for growth of Lm in refrigerated,\nready-to-eat, time/temperature control for safety food, prepared and packaged in a food\nprocessing plant and held in a food establishment. Data from the risk assessment (see\nthe following Annex 3, 3-501.16, Table 1) show a significant reduction in the projected\ncases of listeriosis when refrigerated storage is limited to 41\u00baF. Based on these data\nand conclusions from the risk assessment, FDA continues to recommend that food\nestablishments limit the cold storage of time/temperature control for safety foods,\nready-to-eat foods to a maximum temperature of 41\u00baF.\n3-501.16 \u2013 Table 1.

    "content": "Annex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nFDA is concerned that without continued refrigeration up until the time that the eggs are\ncooked, there would be an opportunity for the egg's defenses to degrade and growth of\nSalmonella Enteritidis to occur. The agency reviewed research indicating that\nSalmonella Enteritidis multiplies at temperatures of 10\u00baC (50\u00baF) and above but can be\ninhibited at lower temperatures, e.g., 8\u00baC (46\u00baF), 7\u00baC (45\u00baF), and 4\u00baC (39\u00baF). Based on\nthis research and USDA's temperature requirement during transport, FDA implemented\nregulations that establish a maximum ambient air temperature of 7\u00baC (45\u00baF) for eggs\nstored and displayed at retail establishments. Amended Federal regulations 21 CFR\nPart 115.50 issued on 2000-12-05 and became effective on 2001-06-04.\nAlthough Congress did not expressly preempt State law in this area, FDA found\npreemption is needed because State and local laws that are less stringent than the\nFederal requirements will not support the important public health goals of these\nregulations. FDA does not believe that preemption of State and local refrigeration and\nlabeling requirements that are the same as or more stringent than the requirements of\nthese regulations is necessary, as enforcement of such State and local requirements\nwill support the food safety goals of these regulations. Accordingly, the preemptive\neffect of this rule is limited to State or local requirements that are not as stringent as the\nrequirements of these regulations; requirements that are the same as or more stringent\nthan FDA's requirements remain in effect.\nHistorical Record of Cold Holding Temperature Provisions\nThe 1976 Food Service Sanitation Manual recommended 45\u00b0F as the cold holding\ntemperature. Based on the available science at the time, the 1993 Food Code lowered\nthe cold holding temperature to 41\u00b0F.\nHowever, stakeholders raised concerns that many of the refrigerators currently in place\nin food establishments would not be capable of maintaining food at that temperature.\nThere was also concern that most of the open-top buffet and food prep table-type units\nbeing built at the time could not reliably maintain food at 41\u00b0F or less. Industry pointed\nout that operators needed to recover investments in new refrigeration equipment\npurchased just before or after a state adopted the 41\u00b0F provision.\nConsequently, the Conference of Food Protection (CFP) recommended the 1997 Food\nCode incorporate the option of having a 5-year phase-in period for the 41\u00b0F\nrequirement to allow for upgrading of existing equipment, and the FDA agreed.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nBy 2006, many states adopted and implemented the phase-in period, the 5 years had\nexpired and they were requiring cold holding at 41\u00b0F or less. In addition, NSF/ANSI\nStandard 7 was revised in 1997 and again in 1999 to ensure that equipment conforming\nto the Standard, including open-top and display units, could achieve the desired\nperformance under conditions typically found in the food service and retail\nenvironments. Thus, there are mechanisms in place to allow industry flexibility in\nholding foods out of temperature control and the exemption for holding at 45\u00b0F was no\nlonger necessary, given equipment capabilities, existing provisions of the Food Code\nthat could be utilized (e.g., variances, time as a public health control), and the impact\non public health. Additionally, the FDA believed this exemption was no longer\nnecessary and perhaps was detrimental to public health protection in light of what had\nbeen learned about the growth and survival of Listeria monocytogenes (LM) in\nrefrigerated foods.\nIn 2006, the CFP recommended (CFP Issue 2006-I-033) and FDA agreed that the\noption of maintaining 45\u00b0F as a cold holding temperature be deleted from \u00a7 3-501.\n\n16. In\nthe Supplement to the 2005 Food Code, the option to maintain 45\u00b0F as the cold holding\ntemperature was deleted from the Food Code and 41\u00b0F became the standard for cold\nholding.\nHot Holding\nIn a January 2001 report, the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria\nfor Foods (NACMCF) recommended that the minimum hot holding temperature\nspecified in the Food Code:\n\u2022\t Be greater than the upper limit of the range of temperatures at which Clostridium\n\nperfringens and Bacillus cereus may grow; and\n\u2022\t Provide a margin of safety that accounts for variations in food matrices, variations\n\nin temperature throughout a food product, and the capability of hot holding\n\nequipment to consistently maintain product at a desired target temperature.\n\nC. perfringens has been reported to grow at temperatures up to 52\u00b0C (126\u00b0F). Growth\nat this upper limit requires anaerobic conditions and follows a lag phase of at least\nseveral hours. The literature shows that lag phase duration and generation times are\nshorter at incubation temperatures below 49\u00b0C (120\u00b0F) than at 52\u00b0C (125\u00b0F). Studies\nalso suggest that temperatures that preclude the growth of C. perfringens also\npreclude the growth of B. cereus.\nCDC estimates that approximately 250,000 foodborne illness cases can be attributed to\nC. perfringens and B. cereus each year in the United States. These spore-forming\npathogens have been implicated in foodborne illness outbreaks associated with foods\nheld at improper temperatures. This suggests that preventing the growth of these\norganisms in food by maintaining adequate hot holding temperatures is an important\npublic health intervention.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nTaking into consideration the recommendations of NACMCF and the 2002 Conference\nfor Food Protection meeting, FDA believes that maintaining food at a temperature of\n57\u00b0C (135\u00b0F) or greater during hot holding is sufficient to prevent the growth of\npathogens and is therefore an effective measure in the prevention of foodborne illness.",

The growth of some bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes, is\nsignificantly slowed but not stopped by refrigeration. Over a period of time, this and\nsimilar organisms may increase their risk to public health in ready-to-eat foods.\nBased on a predictive growth curve modeling program for Listeria monocytogenes,\nready-to-eat, time/temperature control for safety food may be kept at 5o\nC (41o\nF) a total\nof 7 days. Food which is prepared and held, or prepared, frozen, and thawed must be\ncontrolled by date marking to ensure its safety based on the total amount of time it was\nheld at refrigeration temperature, and the opportunity for Listeria monocytogenes to\nmultiply, before freezing and after thawing. Time/temperature control for safety\nrefrigerated foods must be consumed, sold or discarded by the expiration date.\nDate marking is the mechanism by which the Food Code requires active managerial\ncontrol of the temperature and time combinations for cold holding. Industry must\nimplement a system of identifying the date or day by which the food must be consumed,\nsold, or discarded. Date marking requirements apply to containers of processed food\nthat have been opened and to food prepared by a food establishment, in both cases if\nheld for more than 24 hours, and while the food is under the control of the food\nestablishment. This provision applies to both bulk and display containers. It is not the\nintent of the Food Code to require date marking on the labels of consumer size\npackages.\nA date marking system may be used which places information on the food, such as on\nan overwrap or on the food container, which identifies the first day of preparation, or\nalternatively, may identify the last day that the food may be sold or consumed on the\npremises. A date marking system may use calendar dates, days of the week, colorcoded marks, or other effective means, provided the system is disclosed to the\nRegulatory Authority upon request, during inspections.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nFDA/USDA/CDC Listeria monocytogenes Risk Assessment\nIn September, 2003, FDA, in cooperation with USDA/FSIS and CDC, released the\nQuantitative Assessment of the Relative Risk to Public Health from Foodborne Listeria\nmonocytogenes Among Selected Categories of Ready-to-Eat Foods at\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/ScienceResearch/ResearchAreas/RiskAssessment\nSafetyAssessment/UCM197329.pdf. This initiative included the development of 23\nseparate risk assessments and analysis of the relative risks of serious illness and death\nassociated with consumption of 23 categories of ready-to-eat foods. These categories\nincluded: seafood, produce, meats, dairy products, and deli salads.\nIn examining these closely, FDA showed that 5 factors are important in measuring the\npublic health impact to consumers from foodborne listeriosis. These factors are:\n(1) amounts and frequency of consumption of a ready-to-eat food; (2) frequency and\nlevels of L. monocytogenes in a ready-to-eat food; (3) potential of the food to support\ngrowth of the bacterium during refrigeration; (4) refrigerated storage temperature; and\n(5) duration of refrigerated storage before consumption.\nBased on these 5 factors, the 23 categories of ready-to-eat foods were ranked\naccording to their relative risk of contamination and growth of Listeria\nmonocytogenes. The risk categories used were: very high risk; high risk; moderate\nrisk; low risk; and very low risk.\nImpact of the Listeria monocytogenes Risk Assessment on Date Marking\nBased on the results of the risk assessment and the recommendations from the\n2004 Conference for Food Protection meeting, it was necessary to re-evaluate\ndate marking in an effort to focus the provision on very high and high risk foods,\nwhile at the same time, exempting foods that present a very low, or low risk of\ncontamination and growth of Listeria monocytogenes. Based on this evaluation,\ndate marking provisions of the Food Code do not apply to the following foods:\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nDeli Salads Prepared and Packaged in a Food Processing Plant\nExamples of deli salads include ham salad, chicken salad, egg salad, seafood\nsalad, pasta salad, potato salad, and macaroni salad, manufactured according to\n21 CFR 110. According to data from the risk assessment, deli salads prepared\nand packaged by a food processing plant contain sufficient acidity, along with the\naddition of preservatives (e.g., sorbate, benzoates), to prevent the growth of\nListeria monocytogenes. There are estimates that 85% of all deli salads are\nprepared and packaged in a food processing plant and do not support growth.\nBased on discussions with deli salad manufacturers and trade associations, it is a\nnearly universal practice for food processing plants preparing and packaging deli\nsalads to add one or more preservatives that inhibit the growth of Listeria\nmonocytogenes. Based on their wide use within this segment of the industry and\ntheir effectiveness at inhibiting the growth of Listeria monocytogenes, all deli\nsalads prepared and packaged in a food processing plant are exempt from date\nmarking. However, all deli salads prepared in a food establishment require date\nmarking.\nHard and Semi-Soft Cheeses\nIn December, 1999, FDA issued an exemption from date marking for certain types\nof hard and semi-soft cheeses\n(http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/IndustryandR\negulatoryAssistanceandTrainingResources/ucm113942.htm), based on the\npresence of several factors that may control the growth of Listeria\nmonocytogenes. These factors may include organic acids, preservatives,\ncompeting microorganisms, pH, water activity, or salt concentration. The results of\nthe risk assessment support this interpretation and therefore, hard and semi-soft\ncheeses each manufactured according to 21 CFR 133 are exempt from date\nmarking.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nList of Hard Cheeses Exempt from\nDate Marking\nList of Semi-Soft Cheeses Exempt\nfrom Date Marking\nAsadero Asiago soft\nAbertam Battelmatt\nAppenzeller Bellelay (blue veined)\nAsiago medium or old Blue\nBra Brick\nCheddar Camosum\nChristalinna Chantelle\nColby Edam\nCotija Anejo Fontina\nCotija Gorgonzola (blue veined)\nCoon Gouda\nDerby Havarti\nEmmentaler Konigskase\nEnglish Dairy Limburger\nGex (blue veined) Milano\nGloucester Manchego\nGjetost Monterey\nGruyere Muenster\nHerve Oka\nLapland Port du Salut\nLorraine Provolone\nOaxaca Queso de Bola\nParmesan Queso de la Tierra\nPecorino Robbiole\nQueso Anejo Roquefort (blue veined)\nQueso Chihuahua Samsoe\nQueso de Prensa Tilsiter\nRomanello Trappist\nRomano\nReggiano\nSapsago\nSassenage (blue veined)\nStilton (blue veined)\nSwiss\nTignard (blue veined)\nVize\nWensleydale (blue veined)\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines",

Many of these products often are low pH\nfoods manufactured with lactic acid fermentation. Data from the risk assessment\nshow that Listeria monocytogenes does not grow in these foods and therefore,\nthese products are exempt from date marking.\nPreserved Fish Products\nPreserved fish products include pickled herring and dried, or salted cod, and other\nacidified fish products, manufactured according to 21 CFR 114. Data from the risk\nassessment show that the high salt and/or acidity of these products does not allow\nfor the growth of Listeria monocytogenes and therefore, these products are\nexempt from date marking. This exemption does not apply to hot or cold smoked\nfish products, nor does it apply to fish products that are dried, marinated, or\notherwise preserved on-site, in a food establishment, such as ceviche.\nShellstock\nAlthough Listeria monocytogenes has been isolated from shellstock there have been\nno reported Listeriosis cases linked to the consumption of this product at retail. The\ncompetitive microflora present in and on shellstock inhibits the growth of Listeria\nmonocytogenes to harmful levels when the product is held under refrigeration at retail.\nTherefore shelllstock are exempt from date marking.\nUSDA-regulated products\nDate marking provisions of the Food Code do not apply to shelf stable ready-to-eat meat\nand poultry products. Shelf stable ready-to-eat meat and poultry products are not required\nby USDA to be labeled \u201cKeep Refrigerated.\u201d For these products, the nitrite and salt in the\ncure and the lower pH resulting from fermentation give additional protection against\nmicrobial growth. Some fermented sausages and salt-cured products are shelf stable, do\nnot require refrigeration, and do not bear the label \u201cKeep Refrigerated.\u201d To be shelf stable,\na product manufactured under USDA inspection must have a process that results in a\nproduct that meets one of the recognized objective criteria for shelf stability, such as water\nactivity, moisture-protein ratio (MPR), or combination of MPR and pH (acidity). Therefore\nthey are exempt from the Food Code date marking requirements.\nShelf stable fermented sausages such as pepperoni and dry salami do not have to be\nrefrigerated or date marked. Shelf stable salt-cured products such as prosciutto, country\ncured ham, or Parma ham do not require refrigeration or Food Code date marking. Other\nsalt-cured products include basturma, breasaola, coppa, and capocolla.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nSome ready-to-eat fermented sausages and salt-cured products must be refrigerated\nand therefore bear the USDA-required label \u201cKeep Refrigerated.\u201d Examples of these\nproducts are cooked bologna, cooked salami, and sliced country ham which are readyto-eat fermented products that need refrigeration. Bologna is a cooked, perishable\nsausage and there are other salamis, e.g., cotto that are perishable.\nThe intact casing on shelf-stable sausages may be overwrapped to protect the cut face\nof the sausage. With shelf stable (non-time/temperature control for safety food)\nsausages, the intact casing provides a barrier to contamination (although not an\nabsolute one), the exposed face is likely to be sliced again within 4 or 7 days, and\ncontamination is minimized because only the face is exposed. The coagulated protein\nthat occurs on the surface of some nonshelf stable cooked sausages is not a casing.\nSlices of cured and fermented sausages that require refrigeration and are kept for\n24 hours or longer do need to be date marked.\nIf open dating information is applied to lunchmeats at a federally inspected meat or\npoultry establishment, the information must comply with the requirements in 9 CFR\n317.8 and 381.\n\n129. However, such dating is not required by USDA/FSIS and if applied,\nwould not supercede or replace date marking requirements established by the Food\nCode or by State/local authorities that apply after the food is opened in a retail\nestablishment.\nManufacturer\u2019s use-by dates\nIt is not the intent of this provision to give a product an extended shelf life beyond that\nintended by the manufacturer. Manufacturers assign a date to products for various\nreasons, and spoilage may or may not occur before pathogen growth renders the\nproduct unsafe. Most, but not all, sell-by or use-by dates are voluntarily placed on food\npackages.\nAlthough most use-by and sell-by dates are not enforceable by regulators, the\nmanufacturer's use-by date is its recommendation for using the product while its quality\nis at its best. Although it is a guide for quality, it could be based on food safety reasons.\nIt is recommended that food establishments consider the manufacturer\u2019s information as\ngood guidance to follow to maintain the quality (taste, smell, and appearance) and\nsalability of the product. If the product becomes inferior quality-wise due to time in\nstorage, it is possible that safety concerns are not far behind.\nIt is not the intention of this provision that either the manufacturer\u2019s date or the date\nmarked by the food establishment be placed on consumer packages.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines",

    "content": "3-501.19 Using Time as a Public Health Control.\nThe 2000 Conference for Food Protection (CFP) meeting recommended that FDA ask\nthe National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF) to\nreview the Food Code provision that addresses using time alone as a public health\ncontrol, section 3-501.\n\n19. In response to the CFP recommendation, FDA in\nconsultation with USDA/FSIS, determined that there is sufficient scientific information\navailable to support the current provision in the Food Code without requesting\nconsideration by the NACMCF. As an alternative response, FDA informed the CFP that\nit would provide the following position paper on using time alone as a public health\ncontrol.\nPosition Paper\nFood Code section 3-501.19 allows time/temperature control for safety food that is\nready-to-eat (RTE) to be stored without temperature control for up to 4 hours, after\nwhich it must be discarded or consumed or for up to 6 hours for refrigerated food, if the\nfood is 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F) when initially removed from temperature control, and as long as the\nfood temperature does not exceed 21\u00b0C (70\u00b0F). The following information is provided to\nexplain the reasoning in allowing time alone to be used as a public health control for\nfood safety.\nBackground Information\nFood kept without temperature control allows product to warm or cool as it equilibrates\nwith the environment. Each temperature scenario incurs different risks in regard to the\ntype of foodborne pathogens able to grow and the rate of growth likely to occur. For\nboth cooling and warming conditions, growth depends on the amount of time the food\nspends in an optimum growth temperature range during its equilibration with its\nsurroundings. Several factors influence the rate of temperature change in a food, such\nas the type of food, thickness of the food, and temperature differential between the food\nand its surroundings. When evaluating the safety of a 4-hour limit for food with no\ntemperature control, products and environmental parameters must be selected to\ncreate a worst-case scenario for pathogens growth and possible toxin production.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nHolding Cold Food Without Temperature Control\nWhen a food is removed from refrigerated storage and begins to warm to room\ntemperature, Listeria monocytogenes is a primary organism of concern. Even while\nfood is held at refrigeration temperatures, the growth potential of L. monocytogenes\nwarrants concern for time/temperature control for safety foods RTE foods. Although the\nFDA and USDA have a zero tolerance for L. monocytogenes in RTE food, conditions\nare permitted in the Food Code that would allow L. monocytogenes cells 1 log of\ngrowth (3.3 generations). Salmonella is also a concern especially with products\ncontaining eggs. However L. monocytogenes grows more rapidly than Salmonella at\nrefrigeration and room temperatures. By ensuring minimal Listeria growth in food, the\nthreat from Salmonella would be negligible. Warming conditions will allow food to\nremain exposed to temperatures that allow B. cereus to produce emetic toxin.\nHowever the 4-hour time constraint in the Food Code is sufficient to prevent any toxin\nformation.\nFor food refrigerated at 41\u00baF or 45\u00b0F then transferred to an ambient temperature of\n75\u00b0F for 4 hours, the growth rate of L. monocytogenes remains slow enough to ensure\nthat the critical limit of 1 log growth is not reached. Published generation times at 75\u00b0F\nfor L. monocytogenes in food were not found, however published values at 68\u00baF and\n70\u00b0F in egg and milk products confirmed slow L. monocytogenes growth at room\ntemperatures.\nUsing the USDA Pathogen Modeling Program (PMP) and assuming the optimum\nconditions of pH 6.8, 0.5% NaCl, 0.0% nitrite, L. monocytogenes would require more\nthan 4 hours to grow 1 log at 75\u00b0F. The PMP is based on broth studies and not on food\nproducts. Therefore, the growth rates reported at various temperatures by the PMP are\nfaster than growth rates in most food products. Another factor exaggerating the growth\nrate in this warming scenario as predicted by the PMP is the assumption that the food\nproduct spent all 4 hours at 75\u00b0F. Obviously food equilibrates with the surrounding\nenvironment at a gradual rate and would not equilibrate instantly.\nUnfortunately there are no models that take changing temperatures into consideration\nwhen predicting growth. Likewise there are very few published papers dealing with the\ngrowth of organisms in food during warming. The conservative nature of the 4-hour\nlimit for keeping foods without temperature control allows for a needed margin of safety\nif the temperature of the environment is higher than 75\u00b0F.\nIt is important to note that time/temperature control for safety foods held without cold\nholding temperature control for a period of 4 hours do not have any temperature control\nor monitoring. These foods can reach any temperature when held at ambient air\ntemperatures as long as they are discarded or consumed within the four hours.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines",

    "content": "Annex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nHolding Hot Food without Temperature Control\nThe second scenario for food without temperature control exists when food is cooked\naccording to Food Code recommendations, then kept at room temperature for 4 hours\nbefore discarding. Foodborne pathogens of concern for an uncontrolled temperature\nscenario are sporeformers including Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus.\nFood cooked according to Food Code guidelines should be free of vegetative cells.\nHowever, the heat requirements are not sufficient to kill spores of C. perfringens or\nB. cereus and may actually serve as a heat shock that activates the spores. B. cereus\nis found commonly in outbreaks attributed to inadequate hot holding of starchy foods\nlike rice, and has been isolated in a multitude of food products. C. perfringens is found\ncommonly in outbreaks attributed to inadequate hot holding of beef and poultry.\nDespite the prevalence of both spores in nature, C. perfringens cases are estimated to\nbe more numerous than B. cereus cases by a factor of 10.\nB. cereus can produce emetic toxin in food, and the optimum temperature for the\nproduction of toxin is between 77\u00b0F and 86\u00b0F. However, the time needed to produce\nthe toxin is longer than the time the food will be exposed to any temperature range with\na 4-hour holding limit. Both C. perfringens and B. cereus produce enterotoxin inside\nthe intestine of the infected host if substantial numbers of vegetative cells are present in\nthe food (105-7 CFU/g). Although the reported levels of both spores in raw foods vary in\nthe literature, generally the level expected in food can be assumed to be low (around\n10-1000 CFU/g). This implies that conditions allowing 1 log growth of either spore\ncould be tolerated in food.\nDuring the time without temperature control, the temperature of the food could\ndecrease slowly enough to expose spores of both organisms to optimal growth\nconditions for a significant length of time. Like warming, several variables exist that\ndetermine the rate of heat transfer. Because of the wide variety of foods prepared it\nwould be impossible to generalize how fast a typical product loses temperature after\ncooking. As with warming, it is prudent to imagine a worst-case scenario where heat\nloss is slowed. A beef roast slow cooked to 130\u00b0F for the appropriate time according to\nthe Food Code was used as consideration for possible spore growth. Cooking roast\nbeef to 130\u00b0F can create an anaerobic environment in both the meat and gravy. The\nlow internal temperature creates a small temperature differential with the environment\n(assumed at 75\u00b0F), allowing for a slower decrease in the food\u2019s temperature.\nAfter evaluating published studies as well as data collected at the FDA, the surface of a\nroast beef or rolled meat product would lose heat quickly enough to discourage\nsignificant growth of either C. perfringens or B. cereus. If all spores were distributed\non the surface of the product by either pre- or post-cooking contamination, storing this\nproduct for 4 hours at room conditions would be considered safe. Likewise, products\nthat are stirred or products that lose heat faster than a roast would also be considered\nsafe.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nAt the 2004 meeting of the CFP, a committee submitted and the Conference accepted\na document that examined scientific research related to the growth of Listeria\nmonocytogenes, and the influence of time and temperature on its growth.\nThe 2004 CFP report stated that the USDA-PMP program can be used as a tool to\nestimate time periods for a 1-log increase in growth for Listeria monocytogenes in\nideal (laboratory media) growth conditions. Using this modeling approach, at 41\u00b0F,\n45\u00b0F, and 50\u00b0F, the time for a 1-log increase was, 87.8, 53.9, and 34.7 hours,\nrespectively. At room temperature (70\u00b0F) a 1-log increase was noted at 5.2 hours and\nat ideal growth temperatures (95\u00b0F), the reported time for a 1-log increase was 3.0\nhours. In general, the data from the USDA-PMP program provides very conservative\ngrowth data and, in most cases, growth would be expected to be less rapid in a food\nsystem. This table does provide comparative information relative to growth rates at\ndifferent holding temperatures in the event that time was used as a factor in managing\nfood safely.\nThe report further recommended that food could safely be held for up to 6 hours without\nexternal temperature control as long as the food temperature did not exceed 70\u00b0F.\nBased on that report and data from the Quantitative Assessment of the Relative Risk to\nPublic Health from Foodborne Listeria monocytogenes Among Selected Categories of\nReady-to-Eat Foods September 2003, the Food Code allows time/temperature control\nfor safety food to be stored up to 6 hours without external temperature control provided\nthat the food temperature does not exceed 70\u00b0F and the food is discarded or consumed\nat the end of the 6 hours.\nThe Safety of the Time as a Public Health Control Provision from Cooking\nTemperatures (135\u00b0F or above) to Ambient\nFDA conducted in-house laboratory experiments to test the safety of the existing TPHC\nprovisions of 4 hours without temperature control starting with an initial temperature of\n135\u00b0F or above. Clostridium perfringens was chosen to represent a worst case scenario\npathogen for foods allowed to cool from cooking temperatures to ambient without\ntemperature control, because its spores can survive normal cooking procedures, it can\ngrow at relatively high temperatures (>120\u00b0F) and it has a short lag period.\nC. perfringens spores were inoculated into foods that were cooked and then cooled to\nyield a cooling curve that would promote outgrowth as quickly as possible. The growth\ndata suggest that the existing 4-hour TPHC provision will be safe for 6 hours after\ncooking, with the additional 2-hour margin of safety built-in for consumer handling.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines",

Forty-six (46) states are represented, and the data comprises\nseveral food groups purchased from different grocery-store types. The food groups\nrepresented were: pre-packaged lunch meat, deli-counter products, seafood, fresh\nmeat, pre-packaged deli product, liquid dairy, semi-solid dairy product, ice cream,\nfrozen entr\u00e9es, frozen novelties and whipped topping.\nThe study evaluated information regarding time and food temperature at retail food\nstores, time to reach home refrigeration, temperature after transport home, location and\ntype of retail establishment where purchase was made and type of product purchased.\nFor product temperature at retail and after transportation, 5 product categories were\nused: pre packaged lunch meat, pre packaged deli product, deli counter products,\nseafood and fresh meat. These categories were considered most applicable to the\nTPHC recommendations. The temperature ranges for these products at retail and after\ntransport to the home are summarized in Figures 1 and 2 respectively. The data\nsuggest that with current retail refrigeration practices, 25% of items are held above 45\u00b0F\n(Figure 1). The data also show that by the time the product arrives at the home, 98% of\nproducts were at 65\u00b0F or less (Figure 2).\nThe time of transport for all food categories from the retail establishment to home\nrefrigeration was also recorded. The data summarized in Figure 3 shows that over 97%\nof the foods purchased were ready to be placed in refrigeration within 2 hours of\npurchase. For this histogram, all food categories except for frozen entr\u00e9es were\nincluded. Because all foods end up bagged and transported together, the time each\nproduct was transported to the home was considered a valid data point and therefore\nused. Based on the data, a benchmark was established that TCS foods purchased in a\nfood establishment would be either consumed, or placed under temperature control,\nwithin 2 hours.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nFigure 1.

Food can be kept\nwith no temperature stipulations for 4 hours in a food establishment, at which time the\nfood must be cooked and served, served if RTE, or discarded within the four hours.\nHowever, if food does not exceed 70\u00b0F, it may be held for 6 hours and cooked and\nserved, served if RTE or discarded within the six hours. For foods warming from\nrefrigeration to ambient temperatures, the data from the Audits International study\noutlined above, along with simulations from the USDA Pathogen Modeling Program\n(PMP), were used to determine the safety of the existing TPHC recommendations.\nAssuming pathogen growth in foods going from refrigeration (41\u00b0F or less) to ambient\ntemperature, the following parameters were used for the PMP simulation:\n\u2022\t 65\u00b0F was used as the temperature for the entire simulation;\n\u2022\t 2 hours were added to all times (4h or 6h) allowed in the current TPHC\nrecommendation, to factor in transportation time (per the Audits International\nstudy outlined above);\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\u2022\t The data were generated from PMP broth models (pH 6.8), with the minimal\nNaCl and no sodium nitrite.\nTable 1 summarizes the predicted growth of Bacillus cereus (vegetative), Escherichia\ncoli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Shigella flexneri, and Staphylococcus\naureus, using the PMP and based on the assumptions discussed above. The data\npredicted that less than 1-log growth would be seen for each organism, during the\n8 hour time period. Thus, the data show that the current 4 and 6 hour TPHC provisions\nfrom 41\u00b0F or less to ambient, allow minimal growth of a number of pathogens of\nconcern.\nTable 1.

They present a significant health risk if not\nconducted under strict operational procedures. These types of operations may require\nthe person in charge and food employees to use specialized equipment and\ndemonstrate specific competencies. The variance requirement is designed to ensure\nthat the proposed method of operation is carried out safely.\nThe concept of variances may be new to some regulatory authorities. Some\njurisdictions may not have a formal process to respond to industry requests for\nvariances, although informal allowances may have been allowed in specific situations.\nRecognizing the opportunity to use the variance process may require additional\nrulemaking, or at least policy development, at the jurisdictional level. Rulemaking can\nbe used to outline the procedures for a variance request, including the information\nrequired in section 8-103.\n\n11. In addition, the rulemaking process can address the\nregulatory authority\u2019s responsibility to consider an industry\u2019s variance application and an\nappeals process in case a variance is not given due consideration or is denied. The\nConference for Food Protection Variance Committee recommended that regulatory\nagencies adopt a variance review process. General guidance regarding administrative\nprocedures is given below.\nRegulatory authorities considering implementing variances have encountered issues\nrelating to their authority or technical, scientific ability to evaluate or validate a variance\nrequest. From any variance request there may emerge a set of complex issues and\nscientific competencies beyond the ability of the regulatory authority to validate. The\nConference for Food Protection Variance Committee recommended that rulemaking\nshould reflect a multi-level matrix of regulatory agencies ranging from local regulatory\nauthorities through FDA and reflected that recommendation in the following flow chart.\nThe regulatory authority is encouraged to seek input and guidance from authoritative\nsources such as processing authorities, professional associations, or academia. Within\nthe Variance Committee's model, the process for seeking FDA advice begins with the\nRegional Food Specialists.\nExcept for the Interstate Travel Program, FDA generally does not directly regulate retail\nand food service establishments, including entertaining variances for that segment of\nthe industry. FDA is still exploring processes for handling variances on a national basis\nsuch as those received from national chain businesses. In conjunction with the 2000\nCFP Variance Committee, FDA will continue to explore ways to provide assistance and\nguidance to regulators regarding access to scientific and technical resources in order to\nmake science-based decisions regarding variances.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nFDA recommends that regulatory authorities develop a written administrative process\nthat is consistent with, and addresses the information contained in, Food Code sections\n8-103.10, 8-103.11, and 8-103.12, and follow a process consistent with the\nrecommendations of the CFP Variance Committee as shown in its flow chart.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines",

    "content": "3-502.12\t Reduced Oxygen Packaging Without a\nVariance, Criteria.\nReduced oxygen packaging (ROP) encompasses a large variety of packaging methods\nwhere the internal environment of the package contains less than the normal ambient\noxygen level (typically 21% at sea level), including vacuum packaging (VP), modified\natmosphere packaging (MAP), controlled atmosphere packaging (CAP), cook chill\nprocessing (CC), and sous vide (SV). Using ROP methods in food establishments has\nthe advantage of providing extended shelf life to many foods because it inhibits\nspoilage organisms that are typically aerobic. ROP may also offer benefits related to\ntime and labor savings, portion control and quality retention. However, ROP can also\nincrease the potential for the growth of certain pathogens in the absence of the growth\nof competing spoilage organisms. For example, if certain controls are not in place, the\nformation of C. botulinum toxin may occur before spoilage renders the product\nunacceptable to the consumer.\nThe type of food, the production and packaging methods used, and the packaging\nmaterial can impact the level of oxygen present within a package and within the food\nmatrix. Combinations of some or all of these variables may result in an oxygen level\nwithin a package, or within a food matrix, that is less than 21%. While ROP may\ninvolve different foods and different packaging materials, each process is characterized\nby the deliberate removal of oxygen from or the reduction in the oxygen level in the\npackage or the food matrix at the time of packaging.\nCertain foodborne pathogens that are anaerobes or facultative anaerobes are able to\nmultiply under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Therefore special controls are\nnecessary to control their growth. Refrigerated storage temperatures of 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F) may\nbe adequate to prevent growth and/or toxin production of some pathogenic\nmicroorganisms but non-proteolytic C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes are able to\nmultiply well below 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F). For this reason, C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes\nare the pathogens of concern for ROP. Controlling their growth will control the growth\nof other foodborne pathogens as well.\nReduced Oxygen Packaging with Two Barriers\nWhen followed as written, the ROP methods in this section all provide controls for the\ngrowth and/or toxin production of C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes without a\nvariance. Paragraph 3-502.12 (B) identifies an ROP method with secondary barriers\nthat will control C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes when used in conjunction with a\nfood storage temperature of 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F) or less. These barriers are:\n\u2022\t aw of 0.91 or less;\n\u2022\t pH of 4.6 or less;\n\u2022\t cured, USDA inspected meat or poultry products using substances specified in 9\nCFR 424.21; or\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\u2022\t high levels of competing microorganisms such as those found on raw meat or\nraw poultry or raw vegetables.\nThe barriers described above are effective controls for C. botulinum and L.\nmonocytogenes in reduced oxygen packaged foods because:\n\u2022\t C. botulinum will not produce toxin below an aw of 0.91, and the minimum aw for\ngrowth of L. monocytogenes is 0.\n\n92. \u2022\t C. botulinum will not produce toxin when the pH is 4.6 or below and L.\n\nmonocytogenes will generally not grow at this pH under refrigeration\ntemperatures.\n\n\u2022\t Nitrite, used in meat and poultry curing, inhibits the outgrowth of C. botulinum\nspores.\n\u2022\t Most foodborne pathogens do not compete well with other microorganisms.\nTherefore foods that have a high level of spoilage organisms or lactic acid\nbacteria that grow under ROP conditions can safely be packaged using ROP and\nheld for up to 30 days at 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F).\nOther intrinsic or extrinsic factors can also control the growth and/or toxin production of\nC. botulinum and L. monocytogenes.\nFoods that are not time/temperature control for safety food (TCS) should not support\nthe growth of C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes. Therefore the reduced oxygen\npackaging HACCP requirements of sections 3-502.11 or 3-502.12, apply only to TCS\nfoods.\nReduced Oxygen Packaging with One Barrier (Cook-Chill and Sous Vide)\nSome foods may not have secondary barriers to prevent the growth of C. botulinum\nand L. monocytogenes, such as aw, pH, nitrite in cured meat products, high levels of\ncompeting microorganisms or intrinsic factors in certain cheeses. When these foods\nare packaged using a reduced oxygen packaging process, time/temperature becomes\nthe critical controlling factor for growth of C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes. Nonproteolytic C. botulinum spores are able to germinate and produce toxin at\ntemperatures down to 3\u00baC (38\u00baF). Therefore, holding ROP foods at 3\u00baC (38\u00baF) or less\nshould prevent the formation of C. botulinum toxin. L. monocytogenes is able to\ngrow, although very slowly, at temperatures down to - 1\u00baC (30\u00baF). The lag phase and\ngeneration time of both pathogens becomes shorter as the storage temperature\nincreases. In \u00b6 3-502.12(D), cook-chill processing where food is cooked then sealed in\na barrier bag while still hot and sous vide processing where food is sealed in a barrier\nbag and then cooked, both depend on time/temperature alone as the only barrier to\npathogenic growth. Therefore, monitoring critical limits including those established for\ncooking to destroy vegetative cells, cooling to prevent outgrowth of spores/toxin\nproduction, and maintaining cold storage temperatures to inhibit growth and/or toxin\nproduction of any surviving pathogens is essential. Three separate options are\nprovided in (D)(2)(e).\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines",

(L. monocytogenes will be eliminated by the cooking\nprocedures specified in \u00b6\u00b63-401.11(A), (B) and (C) and recontamination will be\nprevented by filling the product into the bag while it is still hot (cook-chill) or by cooking\nin the sealed bag (sous vide). C. botulinum will not grow under the specified timetemperature combinations.)\nSince there may not be other controlling factors for C. botulinum and L.\nmonocytogenes in a cook-chill or sous vide packaged product, continuous monitoring\nof temperature control and visual examination to verify refrigeration temperatures is\nimportant. New technology makes it possible to continuously and electronically\nmonitor temperatures of refrigeration equipment used to hold cook-chill and sous vide\nproducts at 1\u00b0C (34\u00b0F) or 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F) or less. Thermocouple data loggers can connect\ndirectly with commonly available thermocouple probes. Recording charts are also\ncommonly used. Temperature monitors and alarm systems will activate an alarm or\ndialer if temperatures rise above preset limits. Nickel-sized data loggers are available\nto record temperatures that can be displayed using computer software. Since surveys\nhave shown that temperature control in home kitchens is not always adequate, food\npackaged using cook-chill or sous vide processing methods cannot be distributed\noutside the control of the food establishment doing the packaging.\nReduced Oxygen Packaging with Cheese\nCheeses, as identified in \u00b6 3-502.12(E), that meet the Standards of Identity for hard,\npasteurized process, and semisoft cheeses in 21 CFR 133.150, 21 CFR 133.169, or 21\nCFR 133.187, respectively, contain various intrinsic factors, often acting synergistically,\nthat together act as a secondary barrier to pathogen growth along with refrigerated\nstorage at 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F) or less. This combination of factors could include some or all of\nthe following:\n\u2022 a lower pH;\n\u2022 salt (NaCl) added during processing;\n\u2022 low moisture content;\n\u2022 added preservatives; and\n\u2022 live competing cultures.\nThe extended shelf life for vacuum packaged hard and semisoft cheeses is based on\nthe intrinsic factors in these cheeses plus the refrigeration temperature of 41\u00b0F or less\nto maintain safety. Examples of cheeses that may be packaged under ROP include\nAsiago medium, Asiago old, Cheddar, Colby, Emmentaler, Gruyere, Parmesan,\nReggiano, Romano, Sapsago, Swiss, pasteurized process cheese, Asiago fresh and\nsoft, Blue, Brick, Edam, Gorgonzola, Gouda, Limburger, Monterey, Monterey Jack,\nMuenster, Provolone, and Roquefort. Soft cheeses such as Brie, Camembert, Cottage,\nand Ricotta may not be packaged under reduced oxygen because of their ability to\nsupport the growth of L. monocytogenes under modified atmosphere conditions.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nReduced Oxygen Packaging with Fish\nUnfrozen raw fish and other seafood are specifically excluded from ROP at retail\nbecause of these products\u2019 natural association with non-proteolytic C. botulinum\n(primarily type E) which grows at 3o\nC (37-38o\nF). ROP of fish and seafood that are\nfrozen before, during and after the ROP packaging process does not present this\nhazard.\nHACCP Plans with Reduced Oxygen Packaging\nA Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan is essential when using\nROP processing procedures. C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes are potential\nhazards which must be controlled in most TCS foods. Critical control points, critical\nlimits, monitoring, record keeping, corrective actions, and verification procedures will\nvary based on the type of food and type of ROP technology used. Developing a\nHACCP plan and providing a copy to the regulatory authority prior to implementation\nprovides notice to the regulatory authority that the food establishment intends to\nconduct ROP operations and makes it possible to verify that the appropriate ROP\nprocedures are being followed and that the requirements of \u00a7 3-502.12 are being met.\nWhen a food establishment intends to conduct ROP and hold the product for more than\n48 hours without using one of the secondary barriers defined in section 3-502.12 (the\ncriteria specified in paragraph 3-502.12(D) combined with holding the product at 5\u00b0C\n(41\u00b0F) or less, or hard or semisoft cheeses manufactured using Standards of Identity\nfor those cheeses), it is important that an application for a variance (under section 3\u00ad\n502.11) provide evidence that the ROP methodology intended for use is safe.\nThe Relationship Between Time and Reduced Oxygen Packaging\nTime is also a factor that must be considered in ROP at retail. The use of date labels\non VP, MAP, and CAP products and assuring those dates do not exceed the\nmanufacturer\u2019s \u201csell by\u201d or \u201cuse by\u201d date is intended to limit the shelf life to a safe time\nperiod (based on a time in which growth will not occur or involves the presence of two\nbarriers to growth). When these ROP products are frozen, there is no longer a\nrestricted shelf life. The shelf life limits for cook-chill and sous-vide foods are based on\nkilling all vegetative cells in the cooking process, preventing recontamination, and then\nrefrigerating at 1\u00b0C (34\u00b0F) or less for 30 days or 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F) or less for 7 days after\npackaging, with stringent temperature monitoring and recording requirements. These\ncriteria allow both institutional-sized cook-chill operations that may feed thousands\ndaily, often including transportation to their satellite locations, and individual restaurants\nwithout ice banks and tumble or blast chillers to safely use cook-chill and sous-vide\nprocesses.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n3-502.12 (F) exempts refrigerated, ROP foods that are always removed from the\npackage within 48 hours of packaging from the requirements in section 3-502.12\nbecause growth and toxin formation by anaerobic pathogens in that limited time frame\nis not considered a significant hazard in such foods.\nAccurate\nRepresentation",

    "content": "3-602.12 Other Forms of Information.\nThe identity of a food in terms of origin and composition is important for instances when\na food may be implicated in a foodborne illness outbreak and for nutritional information\nrequirements. Ingredient information is needed by consumers who have allergies to\ncertain food or ingredients. The appearance of a food should not be altered or\ndisguised because it is a cue to the consumer of the food's identity and condition.\nFood Labels and other forms of Information\nFood labels serve as a primary means by which consumers can make informed\ndecisions about their food selections. Many items in a food establishment are provided\nby the food employee to the consumer upon consumer request. When a consumer\norders a specific food or specific amount of food from a food employee, that employee\nmay put the food in a wrapper or carry-out container at the time the order is placed.\nThis food is not considered \u201cpackaged\u201d, per the Food Code definition; it was merely\nwrapped or placed in a carry-out container to facilitate service and delivery of the food\nto the consumer in a protected manner. When food is under the direct control of the\noperator and provided to the consumer upon consumer request, the consumer has an\nopportunity to ask about ingredients, nutrients, allergens and weight.\nAlternatively, some food items are enclosed in a container or wrapping for use in the\ndisplay of that item for consumer self-service. In these instances, the label provides an\nimportant source of information for consumers to answer questions about ingredients,\nallergens, weight, and manufacturer.\nList of Ingredients\nA list of ingredients on the label enables a consumer to make an informed decision\nabout a packaged food product. Therefore it is important that the list of ingredients\naccurately describe all of the ingredients present in the food. In some instances, an\ningredient itself may be composed of two or more ingredients, or sub-ingredients. The\n21 CFR 101.4(b)(2), calls for the sub-ingredients to be declared on the label - d. One\nexample includes parenthetically listing the individual sub-ingredients in descending\norder of predominance after the common or usual name of the main ingredient, as\nillustrated here:\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\u2022\t Bread pudding: bread (wheat flour, water, yeast, salt, honey), milk,\neggs, and sugar\nAnother example is to incorporate the common or usual name of each sub ingredient\ninto the list of ingredients in descending order of predominance in the finished food\nwithout listing the ingredient itself, as illustrated here :\n\u2022\t Bread pudding: milk, wheat flour, water, eggs, sugar, yeast, salt, and\nhoney.\nFood Allergen Labeling\nThe Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (Public Law 108\u00ad\n282) require that all affected packages of food labeled on or after 2006-01-01\nidentify on the label the names of the food sources of any major food allergens (i.e., the\nfollowing eight foods and any protein derived from them: milk, egg, fish, Crustacean\nshellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans) used as ingredients in the food.\nProviding the name of the food source on the label of packaged foods alerts consumers\nto the presence of a major food allergen and may prevent an inadvertent exposure.\nThe names of the food sources are the same as the names of the eight foods that are\nmajor food allergens, with the exception that for fish, crustacean shellfish, and tree\nnuts, their respective food source names are the specific species of fish (e.g., bass,\nflounder, or cod), the specific species of crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, or\nshrimp), and the specific types of tree nuts (e.g., almonds, pecans, or walnuts).\nNutrition Labeling\nCertain requirements in the CFR relating to aspects of nutrition labeling became\neffective in May, 1997. The following attempts to provide guidance regarding those\nrequirements and exemptions as they relate to the retail environment and to alert\nregulators to authority that has been given to them by the Nutrition Labeling and\nEducation Act (NLEA) of 1990. The statute and the CFR should be reviewed to ensure\na comprehensive understanding of the labeling requirements.\nI. The following foods need not comply with nutrition labeling in the CFR referenced\nin subparagraph 3-602.11(B)(6) if they do not bear a nutrient claim, health claim, or\nother nutrition information:\n(A) Foods packaged in a food establishment if:\n(1) The food establishment has total annual sales to consumers of no\nmore than $500,000 (or no more than $50,000 in food sales alone), and\n(2) The label of the food does not bear a reference to the manufacturer\nor processor other than the food establishment;\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n(B) Low-volume food products if:\n(1) The annual sales are less than 100,000 units for which a notification\nclaiming exemption has been filed with FDA's Office of Nutritional\nProducts Labeling and Dietary Supplements Food Labeling by a small\nbusiness with less than 100 full-time equivalent employees, or\n(2) The annual sales are less than 10,000 units by a small business with\nless than 10 full-time equivalent employees;\n(C) Foods served in food establishments with facilities for immediate\nconsumption such as restaurants, cafeterias, and mobile food establishments,\nand foods sold only in those establishments;\n(D) Foods similar to those specified in the preceding bullet but that are sold by\nfood establishments without facilities for immediate consumption such as\nbakeries and grocery stores if the food is:\n(1) Ready-to-eat but not necessarily for immediate consumption,\n(2) Prepared primarily in the food establishment from which it is sold, and\n(3) Not offered for sale outside the food establishment;\n(E) Foods of no nutritional significance such as coffee;\n(F) Bulk food for further manufacturing or repacking; and\n(G) Raw fruits, vegetables, and fish.\nII. Game animal meats shall provide nutrition information which may be provided by\nlabeling displayed at the point of purchase such as on a counter card, sign, tag\naffixed to the food, or some other appropriate device.\nIII. Food packaged in a food processing plant or another food establishment, shall\nmeet the requirements specified in \u00a7 3-602.11 and enforcement by the regulatory\nauthority is authorized in the NLEA, Section 4.

    "content": "3-603.11 Consumption of Raw or Undercooked Animal\nFoods.\nRefer to the public health reason for \u00a7 3-401.\n\n11. Purpose:\nAt issue is the role of government agencies, the regulated industry, and others in\nproviding notice to consumers that animal-derived foods that are not subjected to\nadequate heat treatment pose a risk because they may contain biological agents that\ncause foodborne disease. The deliverance of a balanced message that communicates\nfairly to all consumers and, where epidemiologically supported, attempts to place risk in\nperspective based on the consumer's health status and the food being consumed is\npart of the challenge. Notification of risk must be achieved via a meaningful message\nand in a manner that is likely to affect behavior. The following information is to alert the\nreader to the options available to food establishments in advising consumers of the\nincreased possibility of foodborne illness when animal-derived foods are eaten raw or\nundercooked.\nBackground:\nAlthough no specific advisory language was recommended, beginning with the 1993\nFood Code, FDA included a codified provision for a point-of-purchase consumer\nadvisory and stated in Annex 3:\n\"FDA has requested comments and will consider the responses as well as other\ninformation that is available related to the risks involved and methods of risk\ncommunication to determine what action may be necessary by FDA to effectively\ninform consumers.\"\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nConsumer Focus Groups:\nDuring 1996 - 1998, FDA conducted two different consumer focus group studies.\nBecause the first set of focus groups (conducted before the 1997 Code) were not\nreceptive to the language recommended at the 1996 Conference for Food Protection\n(CFP) meeting, that language was not included in the 1997 Code. Before the 1998\nCFP meeting, the Agency convened a second set of focus groups with a modified\napproach. The latter set expressed similar thoughts as those in the earlier set and a\npattern for consumer acceptance and receptiveness to menu-based advisories\nemerged.\nIt became apparent that there is a general appreciation for \"disclosure\" of what\nconsumers view as \"hidden ingredients, \" for example, whether a particular menu item\ncontains raw egg. In addition to disclosure being viewed as helpful, consumers are\naccepting, if not appreciative, of a \"reminder\" that consuming raw or undercooked\nanimal-derived foods carries an increased risk of foodborne illness. In the food\nestablishment venue, consumers are less willing to accept a message that extends\nbeyond a reminder and becomes a lesson or an educational message.\nSatisfactory Compliance:\nFDA submitted to the 1998 CFP meeting an Issue that asked the Conference to discuss\nan approach that incorporated the knowledge obtained from the consumer testing. It\nwas the consensus of the CFP that satisfactory compliance with the Code\u2019s\nconsumer advisory provision is fulfilled when both a disclosure and reminder are\nprovided, as described in \u00a7 3-603.11 of the Code. Disclosure is achieved when there\nis clear identification of animal-derived foods that are sold or served raw or\nundercooked, and of items that either contain or may contain (to allow for ingredient\nsubstitution) such raw or undercooked ingredients. A third option for the consumer\n\u201creminder\u201d was added later. The reminder is a notice about the relationship between\nthorough cooking and food safety.\nTwo options were endorsed for disclosure and two for the reminder. One of the\nreminder options is a menu statement that advises consumers that food safety\ninformation about the disclosed items is available upon request. Essential criteria for\nsuch written information are available from FDA through the Retail Food Protection\nTeam by writing to: FDA/CFSAN, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, (HFS-320) College Park,\nMaryland 20740. All brochures must meet these essential criteria. The other option is\na short notice alerting consumers to the increased risk of consuming the disclosed\nmenu items.\nIn response to concerns raised by the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference (ISSC)\nin an 1998-10-08 letter to FDA, a third option has been added to allow for a\nstatement that links an increased risk of illness to consumption of raw or undercooked\nanimal foods by persons with certain medical conditions.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nThe information contained in both the disclosure and reminder should be publicly\navailable and readable so that consumers have benefit of the total message (disclosure\nand reminder) before making their order selections.\nIt is not possible to anticipate all conceivable situations. Therefore, there will always be\nneed for discussion between the food establishment and the Regulatory Authority as to\nthe most effective way to meet the objectives of satisfactory compliance.\nThe Implementation Guidance for the Consumer Advisory Provision of the FDA Food\nCode (section 3-603.11 in the FDA Model Food Code), is a resource intended to assist\nregulators and industry in the implementation of the Consumer Advisory provision. It is\nrecommended that it be used in conjunction with the FDA Food Code. It is available\nfrom FDA through the Retail Food Protection Team by writing to: FDA/CFSAN, 5100\nPaint Branch Parkway, (HFS-320) College Park, Maryland 20740.\nLocating the Advisory:\nDisclosure of raw or undercooked animal-derived foods or ingredients and reminders\nabout the risk of consuming such foods belong at the point where the food is selected\nby the consumer. Both the disclosure and the reminder need to accompany the\ninformation from which the consumer makes a selection. That information could appear\nin many forms such as a menu, a placarded listing of available choices, or a table tent.\nEducational Messages:\nEducational messages are usually longer, more didactic in nature, and targeted to\nconsumers who have been alerted to the food safety concern and take the initiative to\nobtain more detailed information. It is expected that, in most cases, educational\nmessages that are provided pursuant to \u00a7 3-603.11 (i.e., in situations where the option\nfor referring the consumer to additional information is chosen), will be embodied in\nbrochures that will not be read at the site where the immediate food choice is being\nmade. Nonetheless, such messages are viewed as an important facet of arming\nconsumers with the information needed to make informed decisions and, because the\ninformation is being requested by the consumer, it would be expected to play a role in\nsubsequent choices.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines",

    "content": "Annex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nApplicability:\nFood Establishments:\nThe consumer advisory is intended to apply to all food establishments where raw or\nundercooked animal foods or ingredients are sold or served for human consumption in\na raw or undercooked form. This includes all types of food establishments whenever\nthere is a reasonable likelihood that the food will be consumed without subsequent,\nthorough cooking - such as restaurants, raw bars, quick-service operations, carry-outs,\nand sites where groceries are obtained that have operations such as delicatessens or\nseafood departments.\n\"... Otherwise Processed to Eliminate Pathogens... \":\nThis phrase is included in \u00a7 3-603.11 to encompass new technologies and pathogen\ncontrol/reduction regimens as they are developed and validated as fulfilling a specific\nperformance standard for pathogens of concern. Pasteurization of milk is an example\nof a long-standing validated process. For purposes of the Food Code, the level of\npathogen reduction that is required before a raw or undercooked animal food is allowed\nto be offered without a consumer advisory must be equivalent to the levels provided by\n\u00a7 3-401.11 for the type of food being prepared.\nThe absorbed dose levels of radiation approved by FDA on 1997-12-03 for red\nmeat are insufficient to reduce the level of most vegetative pathogens to a point that is\nequivalent to the reductions achieved in \u00b6\u00b6 3-401.11(A) and (B). Irradiated poultry\nprovides a 3D kill which does not provide the level of protection of the 7D kill that results\nfrom the cooking regimen in the Food Code. Therefore, irradiated meat and poultry are\nnot allowed to be offered in a ready-to-eat form without a consumer advisory. It is\nintended that future Food Code revisions will address time/temperature requirements\nthat take into consideration the pathogen reduction that occurs with irradiated foods.\nRecognition of Other Processes:\nAnimal-derived foods may undergo validated processes that target a specific pathogen.\nIn such instances, along with the required consumer advisory may appear additional\nlanguage that accurately describes the process and what it achieves. For example, a\ntechnology for reducing Vibrio vulnificus in oysters to nondetectable levels has been\nvalidated. FDA concurs that shellfish subjected to that process can be labeled with a\ntruthful claim that appropriately describes the product. That is, a statement could be\nmade such as, \"pasteurized to reduce Vibrio vulnificus\" or \"temperature treated to\nreduce Vibrio vulnificus. \" Such a claim must be in accordance with labeling laws and\nregulations, accurate, and not misleading. The claim would not, however, negate the\nneed for a consumer advisory because the treatment only reduces the level of one\npathogenic organism.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nProduct-specific Advisories:\nConsumer advisories may be tailored to be product-specific if a food establishment\neither has a limited menu or offers only certain animal-derived foods in a raw or\nundercooked ready-to-eat form. For example, a raw bar serving molluscan shellfish on\nthe half shell, but no other raw or undercooked animal food, could elect to confine its\nconsumer advisory to shellfish. The raw bar could also choose reminder, option #3,\nwhich would highlight the increased risk incurred when persons with certain medical\nconditions ingest shellfish that has not been adequately heat treated.\nTerminology:\nIt should be noted that the actual on-site (e.g., on-the-menu) advisory language differs\nfrom the language in the codified provision, \u00a7 3-603.\n\n11. In the insert page for\n\u00a7 3-603.11, the Reminder options 2 and 3 use terms for foods that are less specific\nthan the terms used in the actual code section. That is, the words \u201cmeat\u201d rather than\n\u201cbeef, lamb, and pork\u201d and \u201cseafood\u201d rather than \u201cfish\u201d are used. Categorical terms like\n\u201cmeat\u201d are simpler and may be more likely used in conversation, making them suitable\nfor purposes of a menu notice.\nMilk:\nIn addition, \u201cmilk\u201d is not mentioned in the actual on-site advisory language. The sale or\ntransportation of final packaged form of unpasteurized milk into interstate commerce is\nspecifically prohibited by 21 CFR 1240.\n\n61. Also the consumption of raw milk is not\nrecommended by FDA (this statement is in the form of an official FDA position\nstatement found at\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformati\non/Milk/ucm2007973.htm. Nonetheless, approximately 25 states allow unpasteurized\nmilk in intrastate commerce which usually involves direct dairy farm-to-consumer\nprocurement.\nIn the event that a food establishment governed by \u00a7 3-603.11 of this Code operates in\nconjunction with a dairy farm in a State that allows the in-State sale or service of\nunpasteurized milk, or in the case where a State allows unpasteurized milk to be\nmarketed via retail-level food establishments, consumers need to be advised of the risk\nassociated with drinking unpasteurized milk. In these situations, the actual advisory\nlanguage needs to be amended to include milk (refer to Consumer Advisory Reminder,\nparagraph 3-603.11(C), options 2 or 3).\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nMolluscan Shellstock:\nIn addition to areas of retail food stores such as delis in supermarkets, the consumer\nadvisory is to be provided when a seafood department or seafood market offers raw\nmolluscan shellstock for sale or service. There is a risk of death from Vibrio infections\nfrom consuming raw molluscan shellstock for persons who have certain medical\nconditions.\nDisposition 3-701.11\t Discarding or Reconditioning Unsafe,\nAdulterated, or Contaminated Food.\nPathogens may be transmitted from person to person through contaminated food. The\npotential spread of illness is limited when food is discarded if it may have been\ncontaminated by employees who are infected, or are suspected of being infected, or by\nany person who otherwise contaminates it.\nAdditional\nSafeguards",

    "content": "3-801.11 Pasteurized Foods, Prohibited Re-Service,\nand Prohibited Food.\nRefer to the public health reason for \u00a7 3-201.\n\n11. The Code provisions that relate to highly susceptible populations are combined in this\nsection for ease of reference and to add emphasis to special food safety precautions\nthat are necessary to protect those who are particularly vulnerable to foodborne illness\nand for whom the implications of such illness can be dire.\nAs a safeguard for highly susceptible populations from the risk of contracting foodborne\nillness from juice, prepackaged juice is required to be obtained pasteurized or in a\ncommercially sterile, shelf-stable form in a hermetically sealed container. It is important\nto note that the definition of a \u201cjuice\u201d means it is served as such or used as an\ningredient in beverages. Pur\u00e9ed fruits and vegetables, which are commonly prepared\nas food for service to highly susceptible populations, are not juices and do not require\nHACCP plans or compliance with 21 CFR Part 120. There are documented cases of\nfoodborne illness throughout the United States that were associated with the\nconsumption of various juice products contaminated with microorganisms such as\nCryptosporidium, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and\nVibrio cholera. As new information becomes available, the Food Code will be modified\nor interim interpretive guidance will be issued regarding foodborne illness interventions\nfor on-site juicing and pur\u00e9eing.\nThe 21 CFR 120 regulation applies to products sold as juice or used as an ingredient in\nbeverages. This includes fruit and vegetable purees that are used in juices and\nbeverages, but is not intended to include freshly prepared fruit or vegetable purees that\nare prepared on-site in a facility for service to a highly susceptible population.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nIn lieu of meeting the requirements of 21 CFR 120, juices that are produced as\ncommercially sterile products (canned juices) are acceptable for service to a highly\nsusceptible population. Persons providing pureed meals to highly susceptible\npopulations may also wish to use fruit and vegetables that are produced as\ncommercially sterile products (canned fruit or vegetables) as a means of enhancing\nfood safety.\nSalmonella often survives traditional preparation techniques. It survives in a lightly\ncooked omelet, French toast, stuffed pasta, and meringue pies. In 1986 there was a\nlarge multistate outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis traced to stuffed pasta made with\nraw eggs and labeled \"fully cooked.\" Eggs remain a major source of these infections,\ncausing large outbreaks when they are combined and undercooked as was the case in\nthe 1986 outbreak linked to stuffed pasta. Therefore, special added precautions need\nto be in place with those most susceptible to foodborne illness.\nOperators of food establishments serving highly susceptible populations may wish to\ndiscuss buyer specifications with their suppliers. Such specifications could stipulate\neggs that are produced only by flocks managed under a Salmonella Enteritidis control\nprogram that is recognized by a regulatory agency that has animal health jurisdiction.\nSuch programs are designed to reduce the presence of Salmonella Enteritidis in raw\nshell eggs. In any case, the food establishment operator must use adequate time and\ntemperature controls within the establishment to minimize the risk of a foodborne illness\noutbreak relating to Salmonella Enteritidis.\nSince 1995, raw seed sprouts have emerged as a recognized source of foodborne\nillness in the United States. The FDA and CDC have issued health advisories that\npersons who are at a greater risk for foodborne disease should avoid eating raw alfalfa\nsprouts until such time as intervention methods are in place to improve the safety of\nthese products. Further information is available at the FDA website, http://www.fda.gov,\nby entering \u201csprouts\u201d in the search window.\nAlthough the Code\u2019s allowance for the Regulatory Authority to grant a variance (refer to\n\u00a7\u00a7 8-103.10 - .12, 8-201.14, and 8-304.11) is applicable to all Code provisions, variance\nrequests related to the preparation of food for highly susceptible populations must be\nconsidered with particular caution and scrutiny. With all variances, the hazard(s) must\nbe clearly identified and controlled by a HACCP plan that is instituted in conjunction\nwith a standard operating plan that implements good retail practices. Variances that will\nimpact a highly susceptible population must be considered in light of the fact that such\na population is at a significantly higher risk of contracting foodborne illnesses and\nsuffering serious consequences including death from those illnesses, than is the\ngeneral population.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nSubparagraph 3-801.11(F)(3) requires a HACCP plan for the use of raw shell eggs\nwhen eggs are combined in food establishments serving highly susceptible populations.\nA variance is not required since the HACCP plan criteria are specific, prescriptive, and\nconservative and require a cooking temperature and time to ensure destruction of\nSalmonella Enteritidis.\n3-801.11(G) and (H) Re-service of food\nThe Food Code addresses two issues concerning persons in isolation:\n\n1. Contamination from an isolated patient to others outside.\nThe re-service of any food including unopened, original, intact packages in sound\ncondition, of non-temperature controlled for safety food from a person in isolation or\nquarantine for use by anyone else (other patients, clients, or consumers) is not\npermitted. The \u201cisolation or quarantine\u201d terminology in the Code text refers to a patientcare setting that isolates the patient, thereby preventing spread of key pathogens to\nother patients and healthcare workers. Once food packages come to a contact\nisolation room, they stay there until the patient uses or discards them. If packages of\nfood are still in the room when the patient is discharged or moved from isolation, they\nmust be discarded.\n\n2. Contamination from the outside into a room with a patient in a \u201cprotective\nenvironment\u201d isolation setting which protects the patient from contacting pathogens\nfrom other patients, healthcare workers, or other persons.\nPackages of food from any patients, clients or other consumers should not be re-served\nto persons in protective environment isolation. Precautions similar to the isolation\nsetting apply to this setting, i.e., once an unopened, original, intact package of\ncondiment is delivered to this patient, the package stays there until used or discarded.\nNew (not re-served) packages of food should be delivered to this patient each time.\nTo summarize the key difference between the two scenarios:\n\u2022\t Food packages served to patients in contact isolation may not be re-served to other\npatients because of the potential for disease transmission to other patients.\n\u2022\t Patients in protective environments should not be re-served with food packages\nfrom other patients because of the potential for disease transmission to the\nprotective environment patient.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines",

Specifically, lead-based paints that were used to decorate the utensils such as\ncolor glazes have caused high concentrations of lead to leach into the food they\ncontain.\nLead poisoning continues to be an important public health concern due to the\nseriousness of associated medical problems. Lead poisoning is particularly harmful to\nthe young and has caused learning disabilities and medical problems among individuals\nwho have consumed high levels. The allowable levels of lead are specific to the type of\nutensil, based on the average contact time and properties of the foods routinely stored\nin each item listed.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\n\nFDA has established maximum levels (see FDA Compliance Policy Guide Section\n545.450 Pottery (Ceramics); Imported and Domestic \u2013 Lead Contamination (CPG\n7117.07) for leachable lead in ceramicware, and pieces that exceed these levels are\nsubject to recall or other agency enforcement action. The levels are based on how\nfrequently a piece of ceramicware is used, the type and temperature of the food it\nholds, and how long the food stays in contact with the piece. For example, cups, mugs,\nand pitchers have the most stringent action level, 0.5 parts per million, because they\ncan be expected to hold food longer, allowing more time for lead to leach. Also, a\npitcher may be used to hold fruit juice. And a coffee mug is generally used every day to\nhold a hot acidic beverage, often several times a day.\nThe FDA allows use of lead glazes because they\u2019re the most durable, but regulates\nthem tightly to ensure their safety. Commercial manufacturers employ extremely strict\nand effective manufacturing controls that keep the lead from leaching during use.\nSmall potters often can\u2019t control the firing of lead glazes as well so their ceramics are\nmore likely to leach illegal lead levels, although many do use lead-free glazes.\nIn 21 CFR 109.16, FDA requires high-lead-leaching decorative ceramicware to be\npermanently labeled that it\u2019s not for food use and may poison food. Such items bought\noutside the United States may not be so labeled, potentially posing serious risk if used\nfor food.\nPewter refers to a number of silver-gray alloys of tin containing various amounts of\nantimony, copper, and lead. The same concerns about the leaching of heavy metals\nand lead that apply to brass, galvanized metals, copper, cast iron, ceramics, and crystal\nalso apply to pewter. As previously stated, the storage of acidic moist foods in pewter\ncontainers could result in food poisoning (heavy metal poisoning).\nSolder is a material that is used to join metallic parts and is applied in the melted state\nto solid metals.

Carbon dioxide may be released into a water supply because of an\nineffective or nonexistent backflow prevention device between a carbonator and copper\nplumbing components. The acid that results from mixing water and carbon dioxide\nleaches copper from the plumbing components and the leachate is then transferred to\nbeverages, causing copper poisoning. Backflow prevention devices constructed of\ncopper and copper alloys can cause, and have resulted in, the leaching of both copper\nand lead into carbonated beverages.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\n\nBrass is an alloy of copper and zinc and contains lead which is used to combine the two\nelements. Historically, brass has been used for items such as pumps, pipe fitting, and\ngoblets. All 3 constituents are subject to leaching when they contact acidic foods, and\nfood poisoning has resulted from such contact.\nThe steps in beer brewing include malting, mashing, fermentation, separation of the\nalcoholic beverage from the mash, and rectification. During mashing, it is essential to\nlower the pH from its normal 5.8 in order to optimize enzymatic activity. The pH is\ncommonly lowered to 5.1-5.2, but may be adjusted to as low as 3.\n\n2. The soluble\nextract of the mash (wort) is boiled with hops for 1 to 22 hours or more. After boiling,\nthe wort is cooled, inoculated with brewers yeast, and fermented. The use of copper\nequipment during the prefermentation and fermentation steps typically result in some\nleaching of copper.\nBecause copper is an essential nutrient for yeast growth, low levels of copper are\nmetabolized by the yeast during fermentation. However, studies have shown that\ncopper levels above 0.2 mg/L are toxic or lethal to the yeast. In addition, copper levels\nas low as 3.5 mg/L have been reported to cause symptoms of copper poisoning in\nhumans. Therefore, the levels of copper necessary for successful beer fermentation\n(i.e., below 0.2 mg/L) do not reach a level that would be toxic to humans.\nToday, domestic beer brewers typically endeavor to use only stainless steel or stainless\nsteel-lined copper equipment (piping, fermenters, filters, holding tanks, bottling\nmachines, keys, etc.) in contact with beer following the hot brewing steps in the beer\nmaking process. Some also use pitch-coated oak vats or glass-lined steel vats\nfollowing the hot brewing steps. Where copper equipment is not used in beer brewing, it\nis common practice to add copper (along with zinc) to provide the nutrients essential to\nthe yeast for successful fermentation.",

CIP Equipment\n\n\n4-202.12 CIP Equipment.\nCertain types of equipment are designed to be cleaned in place (CIP) where it is difficult\nor impractical to disassemble the equipment for cleaning. Because of the closed nature\nof the system, CIP cleaning must be monitored via access points to ensure that\ncleaning has been effective throughout the system.\nThe CIP design must ensure that all food-contact surfaces of the equipment are\ncontacted by the circulating cleaning and sanitizing solutions. Dead spots in the\nsystem, i.e., areas which are not contacted by the cleaning and sanitizing solutions,\ncould result in the buildup of food debris and growth of pathogenic microorganisms.\nThere is equal concern that cleaning and sanitizing solutions might be retained in the\nsystem, which may result in the inadvertent adulteration of food. Therefore, the CIP\nsystem must be self-draining.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\n\n4-202.13 \"V\" Threads, Use Limitation.\nV-type threads present a surface which is difficult to clean routinely; therefore, they are\nnot allowed on food-contact surfaces. The exception provided for hot oil cooking fryers\nand filtering systems is based on the high temperatures that are used in this equipment.\nThe high temperature in effect sterilizes the equipment, including debris in the \"V\"\nthreads.\n\n\n4-202.14.

The filter is designed to keep the oil free\nof undesired materials and therefore must be readily accessible for replacement.\nFiltering the oil reduces the likelihood that off-odors, tastes, and possibly toxic\ncompounds may be imparted to food as a result of debris buildup. To ensure that\nfiltering occurs, it is necessary for the filter to be accessible for replacement.\n\n\n4-202.15. Can Openers\n\n\n4-202.15 Can Openers.\nOnce can openers become pitted or the surface in any way becomes uncleanable, they\nmust be replaced because they can no longer be adequately cleaned and sanitized.\nCan openers must be designed to facilitate replacement.\n\n\n4-202.16. Nonfood-Contact Surfaces\n\n\n4-202.16 Nonfood-Contact Surfaces.\nHard-to-clean areas could result in the attraction and harborage of insects and rodents\nand allow the growth of foodborne pathogenic microorganisms. Well-designed\nequipment enhances the ability to keep nonfood-contact surfaces clean.\n\n\n4-202.17. Kick Plates, Removable\n\n\n4-202.17 Kick Plates, Removable.\nThe use of kick plates is required to allow access for proper cleaning. If kick plate\ndesign and installation does not meet Code requirements, debris could accumulate and\ncreate a situation that may attract insects and rodents.\nAccuracy 4-203.11 Temperature Measuring Devices, Food.\nThe Metric Conversion Act of 1975 (amended 1988, 1996, and 2004, 15 USC 205a et\nseq) requires that all Federal government regulations use the Celsius scale for\ntemperature measurement. The Fahrenheit scale is included in the Code for those\njurisdictions using the Fahrenheit scale for temperature measurement.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\n\nThe small margin of error specified for thermometer accuracy is due to the lack of a\nlarge safety margin in the temperature requirements themselves. The accuracy\nspecified for a particular food temperature measuring device is applicable to its entire\nrange of use, that is, from refrigeration through cooking temperatures if the device is\nintended for such use.",

The \u00b11.5o\nC requirement is more stringent than the 3o\nF previously\nrequired since \u00b11.5o\nC is equivalent to \u00b12.7o\nF. The more rigid accuracy results from the\npractical application of metric equivalents to the temperature gradations of Celsius\nthermometers.\nIf Fahrenheit thermometers are used, the 3o\nF requirement applies because of the\ncalibrated intervals of Fahrenheit thermometers.\nThe accuracy specified for a particular air or water temperature measuring device is\napplicable to its intended range of use. For example, a cold holding unit may have a\ntemperature measuring device that measures from a specified frozen temperature to\n20o\nC (68o\nF).

The requirement for\nan opening to be flanged upward and for the cover to overlap the opening and be\nsloped to drain prevents contaminants, especially liquids, from entering the food-contact\narea.\nSome equipment may have parts that extend into the food-contact areas. If these parts\nare not provided with a watertight joint at the point of entry into the food-contact area,\nliquids may contaminate the food by adhering to shafts or other parts and running or\ndripping into the food.\nAn apron on parts extending into the food-contact area is an acceptable alternative to\nthe watertight seal. If the apron is not properly designed and installed, condensation,\ndrips, and dust may gain access to the food.",

Due to the number of shellfish and the limited volume of\nwater used, display tanks may allow concentration of pathogenic viruses and bacteria.\nSince many people eat shellfish either raw or lightly cooked, the potential for increased\nlevels of pathogenic microorganisms in shellfish held in display tanks is of concern. If\nshellfish stored in molluscan shellfish tanks are offered for consumption, certain\nsafeguards must be in place as specified in a detailed HACCP plan that is approved by\nthe regulatory authority. Opportunities for contamination must be controlled or\neliminated. Procedures must emphasize strict monitoring of the water quality of the\ntank including the filtering and disinfection system.\n4-204.111 Vending Machines, Automatic Shutoff.\nFailure to store time/temperature control for safety food at safe temperatures in a\nvending machine could result in the growth of pathogenic microorganisms that may\nresult in foodborne illness. The presence of an automatic control that prevents the\nvending of food if the temperature of the unit exceeds Code requirements precludes the\nvending of foods that may not be safe.\nIt is possible and indeed very likely that the temperature of the storage area of a\nvending machine may exceed Code requirements during the stocking and servicing of\nthe machine. The automatic shut off, commonly referred to as the \"public health\ncontrol,\u201d provides a limited amount of time that the ambient temperature of a machine\nmay exceed Code requirements. Strict adherence to the time requirements can limit\nthe growth of pathogenic microorganisms.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n4-204.112 Temperature Measuring Devices.\nThe placement of the temperature measuring device is important. If the device is\nplaced in the coldest location in the storage unit, it may not be representative of the\ntemperature of the unit. Food could be stored in areas of the unit that exceed Code\nrequirements. Therefore, the temperature measuring device must be placed in a\nlocation that is representative of the actual storage temperature of the unit to ensure\nthat all time/temperature control for safety foods are stored at least at the minimum\ntemperature required in Chapter 3.\nInstalling an air thermometer in some open display refrigerators can be difficult without\nphysically impairing the usability of the case and interfering with cleaning and sanitation.\nUse of a temperature monitoring system that uses probe-like sensors that are placed in\nmaterial resembling the density of food is an acceptable alternative. Thus, the direct\ntemperature of the substitute product is measured by use of this product mimicking\nmethod.\nA permanent temperature measuring device is required in any unit storing\ntime/temperature control for safety food because of the potential growth of pathogenic\nmicroorganisms should the temperature of the unit exceed Code requirements. In\norder to facilitate routine monitoring of the unit, the device must be clearly visible.\nThe exception to requiring a temperature measuring device for the types of equipment\nlisted is primarily due to equipment design and function. It would be difficult and\nimpractical to permanently mount a temperature measuring device on the equipment\nlisted. The futility of attempting to measure the temperature of unconfined air such as\nwith heat lamps and, in some cases, the brief period of time the equipment is used for a\ngiven food negate the usefulness of ambient temperature monitoring at that point. In\nsuch cases, it would be more practical and accurate to measure the internal\ntemperature of the food.\nThe importance of maintaining time/temperature control for safety foods at the specified\ntemperatures requires that temperature measuring devices be easily readable. The\ninability to accurately read a thermometer could result in food being held at unsafe\ntemperatures.\nTemperature measuring devices must be appropriately scaled per Code requirements\nto ensure accurate readings.\nThe required incremental gradations are more precise for food measuring devices than\nfor those used to measure ambient temperature because of the significance at a given\npoint in time, i.e., the potential for pathogenic growth, versus the unit's temperature.\nThe food temperature will not necessarily match the ambient temperature of the storage\nunit; it will depend on many variables including the temperature of the food when it is\nplaced in the unit, the temperature at which the unit is maintained, and the length of\ntime the food is stored in the unit.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n4-204.113\t Warewashing Machine, Data Plate Operating\nSpecifications.\nThe data plate provides the operator with the fundamental information needed to\nensure that the machine is effectively washing, rinsing, and sanitizing equipment and\nutensils. The warewashing machine has been tested, and the information on the data\nplate represents the parameters that ensure effective operation and sanitization and\nthat need to be monitored.\n4-204.114 Warewashing Machines, Internal Baffles.\nThe presence of baffles or curtains separating the various operational cycles of a\nwarewashing machine such as washing, rinsing, and sanitizing are designed to reduce\nthe possibility that solutions from one cycle may contaminate solutions in another. The\nbaffles or curtains also prevent food debris from being splashed onto the surface of\nequipment that has moved to another cycle in the procedure.\n4-204.115\t Warewashing Machines, Temperature\nMeasuring Devices.\nThe requirement for the presence of a temperature measuring device in each tank of\nthe warewashing machine is based on the importance of temperature in the sanitization\nstep. In hot water machines, it is critical that minimum temperatures be met at the\nvarious cycles so that the cumulative effect of successively rising temperatures causes\nthe surface of the item being washed to reach the required temperature for sanitization.\nWhen chemical sanitizers are used, specific minimum temperatures must be met\nbecause the effectiveness of chemical sanitizers is directly affected by the temperature\nof the solution.\n4-204.116\t Manual Warewashing Equipment, Heaters\nand Baskets.\nHot water sanitization is accomplished in water of not less than 77o\nC (170o\nF) and an\nintegral heating device is necessary to ensure that the minimum temperature is\nreached.\nThe rack or basket is required in order to safely handle the equipment and utensils\nbeing washed and to ensure immersion.

Flow\npressure devices installed on the upstream side of the control (solenoid) valve are\nsubject to damage and failure due to the water hammer effect caused throughout the\ndishwashing period each time the control valve closes. The IPS valve provides a ready\nmeans for checking line-pressure with an alternative pressure measuring device.

Temperature Measuring Devices, Manual\n\n\n4-302.13 Temperature Measuring Devices, Manual\nWarewashing.\nWater temperature is critical to sanitization in warewashing operations. This is\nparticularly true if the sanitizer being used is hot water. The effectiveness of cleaners\nand chemical sanitizers is also determined by the temperature of the water used. A\ntemperature measuring device is essential to monitor manual warewashing and ensure\nsanitization.\nEffective mechanical hot water sanitization occurs when the surface temperatures of\nutensils passing through the warewashing machine meet or exceed the required\n71\u00b0C(160\u00b0F). Parameters such as water temperature, rinse pressure, and time\ndetermine whether the appropriate surface temperature is achieved. Although the Food\nCode requires integral temperature measuring devices and a pressure gauge for hot\nwater mechanical warewashers, the measurements displayed by these devices may not\nalways be sufficient to determine that the surface temperatures of utensils are reaching\n71\u00b0C(160\u00b0F). The regular use of irreversible registering temperature indicators\nprovides a simple method to verify that the hot water mechanical sanitizing operation is\neffective in achieving a utensil surface temperature of 71\u00baC (160\u00baF).\n\n\n4-302.14. Sanitizing Solutions, Testing Devices\n\n\n4-302.14 Sanitizing Solutions, Testing Devices.\nTesting devices to measure the concentration of sanitizing solutions are required for\n2 reasons:\n\n1. The use of chemical sanitizers requires minimum concentrations of the sanitizer\nduring the final rinse step to ensure sanitization; and\n2. Too much sanitizer in the final rinse water could be toxic.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\n\nLocation 4-401.11 Equipment, Clothes Washers and Dryers, and\nStorage Cabinets, Contamination Prevention.\nFood equipment and the food that contacts the equipment must be protected from\nsources of overhead contamination such as leaking or ruptured water or sewer pipes,\ndripping condensate, and falling objects. When equipment is installed, it must be\nsituated with consideration of the potential for contamination from such overhead\nsources.\nIf a clothes washer and dryer are installed adjacent to exposed food, clean equipment,\nutensils, linens, and unwrapped single-service and single-use articles, it could result in\nthose items becoming contaminated from soiled laundry. The reverse is also true, i.e.,\nitems being laundered could become contaminated from the surrounding area if the\nwasher and dryer are not properly located.\nInstallation 4-402.11\t Fixed Equipment, Spacing or Sealing.\nThis section is designed to ensure that fixed equipment is installed in a way that:\n\n1.

It may be necessary to elevate the equipment.

Failure to meet manufacturer and Code requirements for cycle times\ncould result in failure to clean and sanitize. For example, high temperature machines\ndepend on the buildup of heat on the surface of dishes to accomplish sanitization. If\nthe exposure time during any of the cycles is not met, the surface of the items may not\nreach the time-temperature parameter required for sanitization. Contact time is also\nimportant in warewashing machines that use a chemical sanitizer since the sanitizer\nmust contact the items long enough for sanitization to occur.

Therefore, the manufacturer's instructions must be followed.\nThe temperatures vary according to the specific equipment being used.\n4-501.111\t Manual Warewashing Equipment, Hot Water\nSanitization Temperatures.\nIf the temperature during the hot water sanitizing step is less than 77o\nC (171o\nF),\nsanitization will not be achieved. As a result, pathogenic organisms may survive and be\nsubsequently transferred from utensils to food.\n4-501.112 Mechanical Warewashing Equipment, Hot\nWater Sanitization Temperatures.\nThe temperature of hot water delivered from a warewasher sanitizing rinse manifold\nmust be maintained according to the equipment manufacturer\u2019s specifications and\ntemperature limits specified in this section to ensure surfaces of multiuse utensils such\nas kitchenware and tableware accumulate enough heat to destroy pathogens that may\nremain on such surfaces after cleaning.\nThe surface temperature must reach at least 71\u00baC (160\u00baF) as measured by an\nirreversible registering temperature measuring device to affect sanitization. When the\nsanitizing rinse temperature exceeds 90\u00baC (194\u00baF) at the manifold, the water becomes\nvolatile and begins to vaporize reducing its ability to convey sufficient heat to utensil\nsurfaces. The lower temperature limits of 74\u00baC (165\u00baF) for a stationary rack, single\ntemperature machine, and 82\u00baC (180\u00baF) for other machines are based on the sanitizing\nrinse contact time required to achieve the 71\u00baC (160\u00baF) utensil surface temperature.\n4-501.113\t Mechanical Warewashing Equipment,\nSanitization Pressure.\nIf the flow pressure of the final sanitizing rinse is less than that required, dispersion of\nthe sanitizing solution may be inadequate to reach all surfaces of equipment or utensils.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n4-501.114 Manual and Mechanical Warewashing\nEquipment, Chemical Sanitization\nTemperature, pH, Concentration, and\nHardness.\n\u00ad\nWith the passage of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 and the related\nAntimicrobial Regulation Technical Correction Act of 1998, Federal regulatory\nresponsibility for chemical hard surface sanitizers was moved from FDA (CFSAN/OFAS)\nto EPA (Office of Pesticides Programs, Antimicrobial Division). As a result, the relevant\nFederal regulation has moved from 21 CFR 178.1010 to 40 CFR 180.\n\n940. The Food\nCode contains provisions that were not captured in either 21 CFR 178.1010 or 40 CFR\n180.940, such as pH, temperature, and water hardness. There is need to retain these\nprovisions in the Code.\nThe effectiveness of chemical sanitizers can be directly affected by the temperature,\npH, concentration of the sanitizer solution used, and hardness of the water. Provisions\nfor pH, temperature, and water hardness in section 4-501.114 have been validated to\nachieve sanitization; however, these parameters are not always included on EPAregistered labels. Therefore, it is critical to sanitization that the sanitizers are used\nconsistently with the EPA-registered label, and if pH, temperature, and water hardness\n(for quat) are not included on the label, that the solutions meet the standards required\nin the Code.\nWith respect to chemical sanitization, section 4-501.114 addresses the proper use\nconditions for the sanitizing solution, i.e., chemical concentration range, pH, and\ntemperature minimum levels and, with respect to quaternary ammonium compounds\n(quats), the maximum hardness level. If these parameters are not as specified in the\nCode or on the EPA-registered label, then this provision is violated.\nBy contrast, paragraph 4-703.11(C) addresses contact time in seconds. For chemical\nsanitization, this paragraph is only violated when the specified contact time is not met.\nSection 7-204.11 addresses whether or not the chemical agent being applied as a\nsanitizer is approved and listed for that use under 40 CFR 180.\n\n940. EPA sanitizer registration assesses compliance with 40 CFR 180.940, therefore if the\nproduct is used at the appropriate concentration for the application on the EPAregistered label, it is not necessary to consult 40 CFR 180.940 for further compliance\nverification. If a sanitarian determined that a solution exceeded the concentration for\nthe application on the EPA-registered label or is used for an application that is not on\nthe EPA-registered label, section 7-204.11 would be violated.\nTo summarize, a sanitizing solution that is too weak would be a violation of section\n4-501.\n\n114. A solution that is too strong would be a violation of section 7-204.\n\n11. Section 7-202.12 would not be violated due to the existence of section 7-204.11 that\nspecifically addresses the use chemical sanitizers.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nA variety of hard food contact surface sanitizers such as sodium hypochlorite or\nhypochlorous acid, can be generated on-site by technologies known as electrolyzed\nwater, electro chemically activated water, and electro activated water in pesticide\ngenerating devices. Paragraph 4-501.114(F) addresses the efficacy and use of these\non-site generated solutions and Section 4-703.11 requires that the conditions of use\nyields sanitization as defined in paragraph 1-201.10(B), i.e., a 5 log (99.999%)\nreduction.\nBecause EPA does not require registration of solutions generated and used on-site, the\nuser of the equipment should look to the device manufacturer for data to validate the\nefficacy of the solution produced by the device as well as the conditions for use of the\nsolution (e.g., concentration, temperature, contact time, pH, and other applicable\nfactors). These data should be available on-site in the food establishment.\nAny data used to validate efficacy of on-site generated sanitizer solutions should\ninclude validation testing that includes all factors that could impact the efficacy of the\nsanitizer solution, including water hardness, pH, temperature, and a time element\nbecause efficacy can reduce with time. The report should also clearly identify the\nminimum acceptable concentration of active ingredient required for that product to pass\nthe test. This testing is best performed under Good Laboratory Practices. See the EPA\nweb site at http://www.epa.gov/compliance/monitoring/programs/fifra/glp.html.\nAccording to the web site, \u201cEPA\u2019s Good Laboratory Practice Standards (GLPS)\ncompliance monitoring program ensures the quality and integrity of test data submitted\nto the Agency in support of a pesticide product registration under FIFRA section 5 of\nthe Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), and pursuant to testing consent agreements\nand test rules issued under section 4 of TSCA.\u201d\nVerifying the adequacy of chlorine-based solutions can be accomplished on an ongoing basis by confirming that the concentration, temperature, and pH of the sanitizing\nsolutions comply with paragraph 4-501.114 (A) using acceptable test methods and\nequipment.\nThe manufacturer should provide methods (e.g., test strips, kits, etc.) to verify that the\nequipment consistently generates a solution on-site at the necessary concentration to\nachieve sanitization.\nDevices can be used for years to produce chemicals intended for the washing of fruits\nand vegetables, (e.g., hypochlorous acid, ozone, and chlorine dioxide).

When mollusk or crustacean shells (from commercial sources)\nare re-used by filling them with shucked shellfish, the food is considered misleading and\nnot honestly presented.\nObjective 4-601.11 Equipment, Food-Contact Surfaces, NonfoodContact Surfaces, and Utensils.\nThe objective of cleaning focuses on the need to remove organic matter from foodcontact surfaces so that sanitization can occur and to remove soil from nonfood contact\nsurfaces so that pathogenic microorganisms will not be allowed to accumulate and\ninsects and rodents will not be attracted.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nFrequency 4-602.11 Equipment Food-Contact Surfaces and\nUtensils.\nMicroorganisms may be transmitted from a food to other foods by utensils, cutting\nboards, thermometers, or other food-contact surfaces. Food-contact surfaces and\nequipment used for time/temperature control for safety foods should be cleaned as\nneeded throughout the day but must be cleaned no less than every 4 hours to prevent\nthe growth of microorganisms on those surfaces.\nRefrigeration temperatures slow down the generation time of bacterial pathogens,\nmaking it unnecessary to clean every four hours. However, the time period between\ncleaning equipment and utensils may not exceed 24 hours. A time-temperature chart is\nprovided in subparagraph 4-602.11(D)(2) to accommodate operations that use\nequipment and utensils in a refrigerated room or area that maintains a temperature\nbetween 41o\nF or less and 55o\nF.\nSurfaces of utensils and equipment contacting food that is not time/temperature control\nfor safety food such as iced tea dispensers, carbonated beverage dispenser nozzles,\nbeverage dispensing circuits or lines, water vending equipment, coffee bean grinders,\nice makers, and ice bins must be cleaned on a routine basis to prevent the\ndevelopment of slime, mold, or soil residues that may contribute to an accumulation of\nmicroorganisms. Some equipment manufacturers and industry associations, e.g.,\nwithin the tea industry, develop guidelines for regular cleaning and sanitizing of\nequipment. If the manufacturer does not provide cleaning specifications for foodcontact surfaces of equipment that are not readily visible, the person in charge should\ndevelop a cleaning regimen that is based on the soil that may accumulate in those\nparticular items of equipment.\nRegarding the possible adulteration from one species of meat to another between\ncleaning of food-contact surfaces, USDA/FSIS does not automatically consider species\nadulteration as a health hazard. FSIS stated in an Advance Notice of Proposed\nRulemaking that species adulteration falls into a gray area between safety and\neconomic adulteration (65 FR 14486, 2000-03-17, Other Consumer Protection\nActivities). FSIS will review public comments received on the species adulteration issue\nand further review the scientific literature and risk assessment mechanisms before\ndeclaring species adulteration a health hazard. Meanwhile, species adulteration is\ngenerally considered by FSIS as an economic issue. However, investigations by FSIS\nof species adulteration incidents may include a determination regarding the impact of\nspecies adulteration as a health hazard on a case-by-case basis.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nThe 2012 Conference for Food Protection (CFP) requested that FDA amend \u00a7 4-602.11\nof the Food Code to require that equipment food contact surfaces and utensils that\nhave contacted raw animal foods that are major food allergens be cleaned before use\nwith other raw animal foods (Issue 2012-III-024). FDA recognizes that in addition to\ntheir intended use as ingredients, the unintended presence of major food allergens in\nfoods may occur through cross-contact. Cross-contact describes the inadvertent\nintroduction of an allergen into a product that would not intentionally contain that\nallergen as an ingredient. While most cross-contact can be avoided through control of\nthe environment during food production and preparation, the CFP request only\naddresses allergen cross-contact from raw animal foods that are major food allergens\nand therefore, falls short of comprehensive allergen cross-contact control for all eight\n(8) major food allergens. Although limited in scope, such a change supports the\ncontinued efforts of FDA to work in cooperation with the Conference for Food Protection\ntoward control of food allergens in retail food establishments. Therefore, \u00a7 4-602.11 was\namended to require that food contact surfaces of equipment and utensils that have\ncontacted raw animal foods that are major food allergens, such as raw fish, must be\ncleaned and sanitized prior to contacting other types of raw animal foods.\nRefer also to Annex 4 - Management of Food Safety Principles for Food Allergens as\nFood Safety Hazards.",

It is important that surfaces be clean\nbefore being sanitized to allow the sanitizer to achieve its maximum benefit.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\n\nFrequency 4-702.11 Before Use After Cleaning.\nSanitization is accomplished after the warewashing steps of cleaning and rinsing so that\nutensils and food-contact surfaces are sanitized before coming in contact with food and\nbefore use.\nMethods 4-703.11 Hot Water and Chemical.\nEfficacious sanitization depends on warewashing being conducted within certain\nparameters. Time is a parameter applicable to both chemical and hot water\nsanitization. The time hot water or chemicals contact utensils or food-contact surfaces\nmust be sufficient to destroy pathogens that may remain on surfaces after cleaning.\nOther parameters, such as rinse pressure, temperature, and chemical concentration\nare used in combination with time to achieve sanitization.\nWhen surface temperatures of utensils passing through warewashing machines using\nhot water for sanitizing do not reach the required 71\u00baC (160\u00baF), it is important to\nunderstand the factors affecting the decreased surface temperature. A comparison\nshould be made between the machine manufacturer\u2019s operating instructions and the\nmachine\u2019s actual wash and rinse temperatures and final rinse pressure. The actual\ntemperatures and rinse pressure should be consistent with the machine manufacturer\u2019s\noperating instructions and within limits specified in \u00a7\u00a7 4-501.112 and 4-501.\n\n113.

To prevent the introduction of this liquid into the water supply through\nback siphonage, various means may be used.\nThe water outlet of a drinking water system must not be installed so that it contacts\nwater in sinks, equipment, or other fixtures that use water. Providing an air gap\nbetween the water supply outlet and the flood level rim of a plumbing fixture or\nequipment prevents contamination that may be caused by backflow.\n\n\n5-202.14. Backflow Prevention Device, Design\n\n\n5-202.14 Backflow Prevention Device, Design\nStandard.\nIn some instances an air gap is not practical such as is the case on the lower rinse arm\nfor the final rinse of warewashers. This arm may become submerged if the machine\ndrain becomes clogged. If this failure occurs, the machine tank would fill to the flood\nlevel rim, which is above the rinse arm. A backflow prevention device is used to avoid\npotential backflow of contaminated water when an air gap is not practical. The device\nprovides a break to the atmosphere in the event of a negative pressure within the\nsystem. Minerals contained in water and solid particulate matter carried in water may\ncoat moving parts of the device or become lodged between them over time. This may\nrender the device inoperative.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\n\nTo minimize such an occurrence, only devices meeting certain standards of\nconstruction, installation, maintenance, inspection, and testing for that application may\nbe used. The necessary maintenance can be facilitated by installing these devices in\naccessible locations.",

Hands can become soiled with a variety of contaminants during routine\noperations. The transfer of contaminants can be limited by providing food employees with\nhandwashing sinks that are properly equipped and conveniently located.\nA handwashing sink that is properly located is one that is available to food employees\nwho are working in food preparation, food dispensing, and warewashing areas.\nHandwashing sinks that are blocked by portable equipment or stacked full of soiled\nutensils and other items, are rendered unavailable for employee use. Nothing must block\nthe approach to a handwashing sink thereby discouraging its use, plus it must be kept\nclean and well stocked with soap and sanitary towels to facilitate frequent use. Therefore,\na handwashing sink that is located in the immediate work area, or between work areas\nthat the Code states must be equipped with handwashing sinks, depending upon the size\nand function of the facility, would be considered properly located.

The\npresence of insects and rodents is minimized by protecting outer openings to the food\nestablishment.\nIn the National Fire Protection Association\u2019s NFPA 101, Life Safety Code, 2009 Edition,\ndoors to exit enclosures such as stairs, horizontal exits, or exit passageways are\nrequired to be self closing. The Life Safety Code does not require exterior doors used\nas exits to be self closing, but they can be.\nThe intent of subparagraph 6-202.15(A)(3) is to protect food establishments from the\nentry of insects and rodents by keeping doors closed when not in use. Self-closing\ndevices allow a door to return to its closed position after use. If an exterior door is not\nroutinely used for entry or exit because its use is restricted by the fire protection\nauthority for emergency use only, it is not a portal for the entry of pests and does not\nneed a self-closing device.

The residual\nmoisture found on the hands after washing allows for bacterial and viral transfer to food\nor solid surfaces by touch. The method in which hands are dried is a critical factor in\nreducing chances of cross-contamination by hands to food and environmental surfaces\n(Patrick et al., (1997)).\nWith regard to the addition of air knife technology for hand drying, data reviewed by\nFDA scientists at the FDA\u2019s National Center for Food Safety Technology (Moffitt\nCenter) demonstrates that the use of this technology in hand dryers has been found to\nbe equivalent to the hand drying treatment in existing heated-air devices.\nWhile the Food Code does not specifically address the configuration or ergonomic\ndesign of hand drying devices, technologies employing air knife systems do not appear\nto accommodate the drying of one\u2019s arms and may not be large enough to\naccommodate surrogate prosthetic devices for hands and arms to fit within the handdryer.

Annex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\n\nToilet facilities must be of sanitary design and kept clean and in good repair to prevent\nfood contamination and to motivate employees to use sanitary practices in the\nestablishment.\nHand contact with contaminated surfaces can result in self-inoculation by touching of\nthe nose and mouth. The spread of Shigella sonnei in a nursery school has been\ntraced to contaminated toilets. Experiments by Gerba, et al and Barker and Bloomfield\nhave shown that when bacteria and viruses were seeded into a household toilet, the\ndetection of bacteria and viruses in the fallout droplets from the aerosols produced\nwhen flushing remain airborne long enough to settle on surfaces throughout the\nbathroom. Barker and Bloomfield also demonstrated that Salmonella Enteritidis could\nbe isolated from the air surrounding a household toilet after flushing the toilet.\nNoroviruses which are a major cause of gastroenteritis can be transmitted by fecal-oral,\nairborne inhalation, person-to-person and environmental-to-person routes. Norovirus,\nwhich is highly infectious, is shed in vomitus and stool in high numbers. A study was\nconducted by J. Barker et al to look at the transmission of norovirus via fingers, cloths\nand contact surfaces. The results indicated that where fingers come into contact with\nvirus-contaminated toilet tissue, norovirus is consistently transferred via the fingers to a\nmelamine surface and from there to other typical hand-contact surfaces such as taps,\ndoor handles and telephone receivers. In this study epidemiological evidence suggests\nthat environmental spread from an infective person occurs by settling of aerosol\nparticles on to contact surfaces. Hands can then spread the virus when they touch\ntoilet seats or flush handles contaminated by splash from vomit or aerosol particles\ngenerated during toilet flushing.",

A service animal is not considered to be a pet.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\n\nUnder Title III of the ADA, privately owned businesses that serve the public are\nprohibited from discriminating against individuals with disabilities. The ADA requires\nthese businesses to allow people with disabilities to bring their service animals onto\nbusiness premises in whatever areas customers are generally allowed. Some, but not\nall, service animals wear special collars or harnesses. Some, but not all, are licensed\nor certified and have identification papers.\nDecisions regarding a food employee or applicant with a disability who needs to use a\nservice animal should be made on a case-by-case basis.

Restriction\n\n\n7-202.11 Restriction.\nThe presence in the establishment of poisonous or toxic materials that are not required\nfor the maintenance and operation of the establishment represents an unnecessary risk\nto both employees and consumers.\nPreserving food safety depends in part on the appropriate and proper storage and use\nof poisonous or toxic materials that are necessary to the maintenance and operation of\na food establishment. Even those that are necessary can pose a hazard if they are\nused in a manner that contradicts the intended use of the material as described by the\nmanufacturer on the material's label. If additional poisonous or toxic materials are\npresent, there is an unwarranted increased potential for contamination due to improper\nstorage (e.g., overhead spillage that could result in the contamination of food, foodcontact surfaces, or food equipment) or inappropriate application.\n\n\n7-202.12. Conditions of Use\n\n\n7-202.12 Conditions of Use.\nFailure to properly use poisonous or toxic materials can be dangerous. Many\npoisonous or toxic materials have general use directions on their label. Failure to follow\nthe stated instructions could result in injury to employees and consumers through direct\ncontact or the contamination of food.\nParticular precautions must be taken during the application of poisonous or toxic\nmaterials to prevent the contamination of food and other food-contact surfaces.\nResidues of certain materials are not discernible to the naked eye and present an\nadditional risk to the employee and consumer.\nBecause of the toxicity of restricted use pesticides, they can only be applied by certified\noperators. A certified operator would be aware of the dangers involved in the\ncontamination of food and food-contact surfaces during the application of these\nmaterials.

The risk of serious\nmedical consequences to anyone consuming food stored in these containers coupled\nwith the lack of confidence that all of the material could or would be removed in the\nwash and sanitizing procedures are reasons for prohibiting this practice.\nChemicals 7-204.11 Sanitizers, Criteria.\nSee explanation in \u00a7 4-501.\n\n114. Chemical sanitizers are included with poisonous or toxic materials because they may\nbe toxic if not used in accordance with requirements listed in the Code of Federal\nRegulations (CFR). Large concentrations of sanitizer in excess of the CFR\nrequirements can be harmful because residues of the materials remain. The CFR\nreference that is provided lists concentrations of sanitizers that are considered safe.\nSection 7-204.11 addresses whether or not the chemical agent being applied as a\nsanitizer is approved and listed for that use under 40 CFR 180.940, Tolerance\nexemptions for active and inert ingredients for use in antimicrobial formulations (food\ncontact sanitizing solutions) or 40 CFR 180.2020, Non-food determinations. Because\nthere is no EPA registration of solutions generated and used on-site, the user of the\nequipment should look to the equipment manufacturer for data to validate the efficacy\nof the solution that is generated by the device as well as the conditions for use of the\nsolution.\nSome sanitizers produced by on-site generators are based on gases dissolved in\nsolution. These may present toxicology issues if the gases can come out of solution\nand into the air at high concentrations. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n(OSHA) limits on gases like ozone and chlorine dioxide are outlined in 29 CFR\n1910.1000, Air contaminants. Although the amount of dissolved gas in solution may be\nvery low when evenly distributed through out all the air in a site, the gas may not be\nevenly distributed. This may lead to localized concentrations, e.g., immediately over a\nthree compartment sink, that exceed OSHA limits. It is the responsibility of the permit\nholder and equipment supplier to ensure that the equipment is used in a safe manner\nso that OSHA limits will not be exceeded anywhere in the permit holder's facility.\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines",

This could be due to residues that may remain from the use of compounds\nsuch as unrecognized drying agents. This is why only those chemicals that are\napproved food additives or food-contact substances, generally recognized as safe, prior\nsanctioned or exempted by the threshold of regulation process can be used.\nInformation regarding food contact substances notification may be found on the FDA\nwebsite under the Food Topic in Ingredients and Packaging section at:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/PackagingFCS/default.htm\nChemicals that are not generally recognized as safe, or not authorized by FDA for these\nuses may be submitted for review by filing a Food Additive Petition, a Food Contact\nNotification (FCN), or a request for exemption under the Threshold of Regulation.\nWash chemicals, boiler water additives, and drying agents are classified as food\nadditives because of the possibility that they may end up in food. Therefore, they are\nsubject to review before being used or listed in the CFR. If the chemicals are hard\nfood-contact sanitizers, or washes for raw agricultural commodities (RACs) that are\nused on a farm or in a packing house, then this is under the jurisdiction of the EPA.\n21 CFR 173 Secondary Direct Food Additives Permitted in Food for Human\nConsumption includes a number of regulations permitting certain food additives to be\nused for washing fruits and vegetables. In an effort to be consistent with federal law a\nchange was made in Section 7-204.12 Chemicals for Washing, Treatment, Storage and\nProcessing Fruits and Vegetables, Criteria to include all of 21 CFR 173 so as not to\nexclude the use of other permitted food additives. There is also another mechanism for\napproval of antimicrobial agents for washing fruits and vegetables (i.e., the food contact\nnotification program) as well as GRAS ingredients permitted as antimicrobials or for\ngeneral food use. This revision allows for the use of ingredients that are GRAS for this\nuse and food contact substances which were the subject of an effective food contact\nnotification for this use. 21 CFR 173 includes permitted food additives such as those\nlisted in 21 CFR 173.315 Chemicals used in the washing or to assist in the peeling of\nfruits and vegetables. This section specifically identifies some of the chemicals that\nmay be used in washing fruits and vegetables, regardless of whether the chemicals are\ncommercially produced or generated on site. Sodium hypochlorite is listed in 21 CFR\n173.315 for use in washing fruits and vegetables at levels not exceeding the minimum\namount required to accomplish the intended technical effect. FDA has no objection to\nthe use of calcium hypochlorite in the place of sodium hypochlorite under 21 CFR\n173.\n\n315. Annex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\nOn 2012-12-04, the FDA amended the food additive regulations to provide for\nthe safe use of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) (CAS No. 25155-30-0) as an\nantimicrobial agent for use in wash water for fruits and vegetables without the\nrequirement of a potable water rinse. 21 CFR Section 173.405 specifically identifies\nthis additive as an antimicrobial agent used in wash water for fruits and vegetables.\nThe additive may be used at a level not to exceed 111 milligrams per kilogram in the\nwash water. Fruits and vegetables treated by the additive do not require a potable\nwater rinse. Use of this additive is limited to use in commissaries, cafeterias,\nrestaurants, retail food establishments, nonprofit food establishments and other food\nservice operations in which food is prepared for or served directly to the consumer. To\nensure safe use of the additive, refer to the label or labeling of the additive and/or\nantimicrobial pesticide container for adequate directions. Information on the label is\nrequired in accordance to provisions within 21 CFR 173.405 and the Federal Food,\nDrug and Cosmetic Act. Although the petitioned use of SDBS is regulated under\nSection 409 of the FD & C Act as a food additive, this intended use of SDBS may\nnevertheless be subject to regulation as a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide,\nFungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). EPA requirements pertain to EPA registered\npesticide products that have uses subject to EPA or both FDA and EPA regulations.\nTherefore, manufacturers intending to use this food additive for this intended use\nshould contact the Environmental Protection Agency to determine whether this use\nrequires a pesticide registration under FIFRA.\nBoiler water additives that may be safely used in the preparation of steam that may\ncontact food, and their condition of use, are identified in 21 CFR 173.310 Boiler Water\nAdditives.\nLubricants\t 7-205.11 Incidental Food Contact, Criteria.\nLubricants used on food equipment may directly or indirectly end up in the food.\nTherefore, the lubricants used must be approved as food additives or generally\nrecognized as safe and listed in the CFR.

For several years, this FDA/CFP Food Establishment Plan\nReview Guide \u2013 2000 has been used in the FDA State Training Team Plan Review\ncourses. It can be accessed through\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/IndustryandRegulat\noryAssistanceandTrainingResources/ucm101639.htm.\nAt the plan review stage, the regulatory authority may be dealing with an agent of the\npermit applicant who is seeking a building permit and who is not in a position to discuss\nplans for safely conducting the food operation. Nonetheless, the plan review step\npresents a unique opportunity to lay a foundation that enables the proposed operation\nto proactively sustain compliance with the Code over time. Standard operating\nprocedures (SOPs) are a part of that foundation and ideally are developed in tandem\nwith designing the facility. Consequently, as an integral part of the plan review process,\ndiscussion needs to occur about such procedures and their scope.\nSOPs need to be developed by the time of the preoperational inspection and put into\neffect when the food operation begins. It is recommended that such procedures be\nwritten, available for reference by the person in charge, conveyed to the appropriate\nemployees, and available for review by the regulatory authority during inspections.\nOperating procedures should include definitive practices and expectations that ensure\nthat:\n(1) The transmission of foodborne disease is prevented by managing job applicants and\nfood employees as specified under Subpart 2-201,\n(2) Food is received from approved sources as specified under \u00a7 3-201.11,\nAnnex 3 \u2013 Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n\n\n\n(3) Food is managed so that the safety and integrity of the food from the time of delivery\nto the establishment throughout its storage, preparation, and transportation to the point\nof sale or service to the consumer is protected,\n(4) Time/temperature control for safety food is maintained, including freezing, cold\nholding, cooking, hot holding, cooling, reheating, and serving in conformance with the\ntemperature and time requirements specified under Parts 3-4 and 3-5,\n(5) Warewashing is effective, including assurance that the chemical solutions and\nexposure times necessary for cleaning and sanitizing utensils and food-contact\nsurfaces of equipment are provided as specified under Parts 4-6 and 4-7, and\n(6) Records that are specified under \u00a7\u00a7 3-203.11, 3-203.12, and 5-205.13 are retained\nfor inspection.\nDuring the plan review stage, the regulatory authority and a management\nrepresentative of the proposed food establishment should discuss available training\noptions that may be used to train food employees and the person in charge regarding\nfood safety as it relates to their assigned duties. By the time of the preoperational\ninspection, operating procedures for training should include definitive practices and\nexpectations of how the management of the proposed food establishment plans to\ncomply with \u00b6 2-103.11(L) of this Code which requires the person in charge to assure\nthat food employees are properly trained in food safety as it relates to their assigned\nduties.",

Since the onset of regulatory oversight\nof retail and food service operations, regulatory inspections have emphasized the\nrecognition and correction of food safety violations that exist at the time of the\ninspection. Recurring violations have traditionally been handled through re-inspections\nor enforcement activities such as fines, suspension of permits, or closures. Operators of\nretail and food service establishments routinely respond to inspection findings by\ncorrecting violations, but often do not implement proactive systems of control to prevent\nviolations from recurring. While this type of inspection and enforcement system has\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\ndone a great deal to improve basic sanitation and to upgrade facilities in the United\nStates, it emphasizes reactive rather than preventive measures to food safety.\nAdditional measures must be taken on the part of operators and regulators to better\nprevent or reduce foodborne illness. Annex 5 of the Food Code provides additional\ninformation on conducting risk-based inspections. It should be reviewed in conjunction\nwith the material found in this Annex to better understand the role of the regulator in\nfacilitating active managerial control by the operator.\n(B) Who has the ultimate responsibility for providing safe food to the consumer?\nThe responsibility of providing safe food to the consumer is shared by many people in\nevery stage in the production of food, including consumers, themselves. Since most\nconsumers receive their food from retail and food service establishments, a significant\nshare of the responsibility for providing safe food to the consumer rests with these\nfacilities. Working together with their regulatory authorities, operators of retail and food\nservice establishments can make the greatest impact on food safety.\n(C) How can foodborne illness be reduced?\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Surveillance Report for 1993\u00ad\n1997, \u201cSurveillance for Foodborne-Disease Outbreaks \u2013 United States,\u201d identifies the\nmost significant contributing factors to foodborne illness. Five of these broad\ncategories of contributing factors directly relate to food safety concerns within retail and\nfood service establishments and are collectively termed by the FDA as \u201cfoodborne\nillness risk factors.\u201d These five broad categories are:\n\u2022 Food from Unsafe Sources\n\u2022 Inadequate Cooking\n\u2022 Improper Holding Temperatures\n\u2022 Contaminated Equipment\n\u2022 Poor Personal Hygiene.\nIn 1998, FDA initiated a project designed to determine the incidence of foodborne\nillness risk factors in retail and food service establishments. Inspections focusing on\nthe occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors were conducted in establishments\nthroughout the United States. The results of this project are published in the 2000\nReport of the FDA Retail Food Program Database of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors,\ncommonly referred to as the \u201cFDA Baseline Report.\u201d The Baseline Report is available\nfrom FDA through the following website:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/GuidanceRegulation/UCM123546.pdf. The data\ncollection project was repeated in 2003 and the results are published in the FDA Report\non the Occurrence of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors in Selected Institutional\nFoodservice, Restaurant, and Retail Food Store Facility Types (2004). This second\nreport is available from FDA through the following website:\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/FoodborneIllnessRi\nskFactorReduction/ucm089696.htm.\nThe data collection was repeated again in 2008 and published in a 2009 report This\nwas followed by a Trend Analysis Report covering 1998-2008 that was published in\nOctober 2010. The CDC Surveillance Report and the results from the FDA Risk Factor\nStudies support the concept that operators of retail and food service establishments\nmust be proactive and implement food safety management systems that will prevent,\neliminate, or reduce the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors. By reducing the\noccurrence of foodborne illness risk factors, foodborne illness can also be reduced.\n(D) How can the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors be reduced?\nTo effectively reduce the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors, operators of retail\nand food service establishments must focus their efforts on achieving active managerial\ncontrol. The term \u201cactive managerial control\u201d is used to describe industry\u2019s\nresponsibility for developing and implementing food safety management systems to\nprevent, eliminate, or reduce the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors.\nActive managerial control means the purposeful incorporation of specific actions or\nprocedures by industry management into the operation of their business to attain\ncontrol over foodborne illness risk factors. It embodies a preventive rather than reactive\napproach to food safety through a continuous system of monitoring and verification.\nThere are many tools that can be used by industry to provide active managerial control\nof foodborne illness risk factors. Regulatory inspections and follow-up activities must\nalso be proactive by using an inspection process designed to assess the degree of\nactive managerial control that retail and food service operators have over the foodborne\nillness risk factors. In addition, regulators must assist operators in developing and\nimplementing voluntary strategies to strengthen existing industry systems to prevent the\noccurrence of foodborne illness risk factors. Elements of an effective food safety\nmanagement system may include the following:\n\u2022\t Certified food protection managers who have shown a proficiency in required\ninformation by passing a test that is part of an accredited program\n\u2022\t Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for performing critical operational steps\nin a food preparation process, such as cooling\n\u2022\t Recipe cards that contain the specific steps for preparing a food item and the\nfood safety critical limits, such as final cooking temperatures, that need to be\nmonitored and verified\n\u2022\t Purchase specifications\n\u2022\t Equipment and facility design and maintenance\n\u2022\t Monitoring procedures\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\n\u2022\t Record keeping\n\u2022\t Employee health policy for restricting or excluding ill employees\n\u2022\t Manager and employee training\n\u2022\t On-going quality control and assurance\n\u2022\t Specific goal-oriented plans, like Risk Control Plans (RCPs), that outline\nprocedures for controlling foodborne illness risk factors.\n\nA food safety management system based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point\n(HACCP) principles contains many of these elements and provides a comprehensive\nframework by which an operator can effectively control the occurrence of foodborne\nillness risk factors.",

    "content": "A food safety management system based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point\n(HACCP) principles contains many of these elements and provides a comprehensive\nframework by which an operator can effectively control the occurrence of foodborne\nillness risk factors.\n\n2. INTRODUCTION TO HACCP\n(A) What is HACCP and how can it be used by operators and regulators of retail\nfood and food service establishments?\nHazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) is a systematic approach to\nidentifying, evaluating, and controlling food safety hazards. Food safety hazards are\nbiological, chemical, or physical agents that are reasonably likely to cause illness or\ninjury in the absence of their control. Because a HACCP program is designed to\nensure that hazards are prevented, eliminated, or reduced to an acceptable level before\na food reaches the consumer, it embodies the preventive nature of \u201cactive managerial\ncontrol.\u201d\nActive managerial control through the use of HACCP principles is achieved by\nidentifying the food safety hazards attributed to products, determining the necessary\nsteps that will control the identified hazards, and implementing on-going practices or\nprocedures that will ensure safe food.\nLike many other quality assurance programs, HACCP provides a common-sense\napproach to identifying and controlling problems that are likely to exist in an operation.\nConsequently, many food safety management systems at the retail level already\nincorporate some, if not all, of the principles of HACCP. Combined with good basic\nsanitation, a solid employee training program, and other prerequisite programs, a food\nsafety management system based on HACCP principles will prevent, eliminate, or\nreduce the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors that lead to out-of-control\nhazards.\nHACCP represents an important tool in food protection that small independent\nbusinesses as well as national companies can use to achieve active managerial control\nof risk factors. The Food Code requires a comprehensive HACCP plan when\nconducting certain specialized processes at retail such as when a variance is granted or\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\nwhen a reduced oxygen packaging method is used. However, in general, the\nimplementation of HACCP at the retail level is voluntary. FDA endorses the voluntary\nimplementation of food safety management systems based on HACCP principles as an\neffective means for controlling the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors that\nresult in out-of-control hazards.\nWhile the operator is responsible for developing and implementing a system of controls\nto prevent foodborne illness risk factors, the role of the regulator is to assess whether\nthe system the operator has in place is achieving control of foodborne illness risk\nfactors. Using HACCP principles during inspections will enhance the effectiveness of\nroutine inspections by incorporating a risk-based approach. This helps inspectors focus\ntheir inspection on evaluating the effectiveness of food safety management systems\nimplemented by industry to control foodborne illness risk factors.\nThe principles of HACCP are also an integral part of the draft FDA\u2019s Recommended\nVoluntary National Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards. For regulatory program\nmanagers, the use of risk-based inspection methodology based on HACCP principles is\na viable and practical option for evaluating the degree of active managerial control\noperators have over the foodborne illness risk factors. The complete set of Program\nStandards is available from FDA through the following website:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/ProgramStandards/\ndefault.htm.\n(B) What are the Seven HACCP Principles?\nIn November 1992, the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for\nFoods (NACMCF) defined seven widely accepted HACCP principles that explained the\nHACCP process in great detail. In 1997, NACMCF reconvened to review the 1992\ndocument and compare it to current HACCP guidance prepared by the CODEX\nCommittee on Food Hygiene. Based on this review, NACMCF again endorsed HACCP\nand defined HACCP as a systematic approach to the identification, evaluation, and\ncontrol of food safety. Based on a solid foundation of prerequisite programs to control\nbasic operational and sanitation conditions, the following seven basic principles are\nused to accomplish this objective:\nPrinciple 1: Conduct a hazard analysis\nPrinciple 2: Determine the critical control points (CCPs)\nPrinciple 3: Establish critical limits\nPrinciple 4: Establish monitoring procedures\nPrinciple 5: Establish corrective actions\nPrinciple 6: Establish verification procedures\nPrinciple 7: Establish record-keeping and documentation procedures.\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\nThis Annex will provide a brief overview of each of the seven principles of HACCP. A\nmore comprehensive discussion of these principles is available from FDA by accessing\nthe NACMCF guidance document on the FDA Web Page at:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformati\non/Juice/ucm072557.htm. Following the overview, a practical scheme for applying and\nimplementing the HACCP principles in retail and food service establishments is\npresented.\n(C) What are Prerequisite Programs?\nIn order for a HACCP system to be effective, a strong foundation of procedures that\naddress the basic operational and sanitation conditions within an operation must first be\ndeveloped and implemented. These procedures are collectively termed \u201cprerequisite\nprograms.\u201d When prerequisite programs are in place, more attention can be given to\ncontrolling hazards associated with the food and its preparation. Prerequisite programs\nmay include such things as:\n\u2022\t Vendor certification programs\n\u2022\t Training programs\n\u2022\t Allergen management\n\u2022\t Buyer specifications\n\u2022\t Recipe/process instructions\n\u2022\t First-In-First-Out (FIFO) procedures\n\u2022\t Other Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).\nBasic prerequisite programs should be in place to:\n\u2022\t Protect products from contamination by biological, chemical, and physical food\nsafety hazards\n\u2022\t Control bacterial growth that can result from temperature abuse\n\u2022\t Maintain equipment.\nAdditional information about prerequisite programs and the types of activities usually\nincluded in them can be found in the FDA\u2019s Retail HACCP manuals discussed later in\nthis Annex or by accessing the NACMCF guidance document on the FDA Web Page.\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors",

THE HACCP PRINCIPLES\n(A) Principle #1: Conduct a Hazard Analysis\n(1) What is a food safety hazard?\nA hazard is a biological, chemical, or physical property that may cause a food to be\nunsafe for human consumption.\n(2) What are biological hazards?\nBiological hazards include bacterial, viral, and parasitic microorganisms. See Table 1 in\nthis Annex for a listing of selected biological hazards. Bacterial pathogens comprise the\nmajority of confirmed foodborne disease outbreaks and cases. Although cooking\ndestroys the vegetative cells of foodborne bacteria to acceptable levels, spores of\nspore-forming bacteria such as Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, and Clostridium\nperfringens survive cooking and may germinate and grow if food is not properly cooled\nor held after cooking. The toxins produced by the vegetative cells of Bacillus cereus,\nClostridium botulinum, and Staphylococcus aureus may not be destroyed to safe levels\nby reheating. Post-cook recontamination with vegetative cells of bacteria such as\nSalmonellae and Campylobacter jejuni is also a major concern for operators of retail\nand food service establishments.\nViruses such as norovirus, hepatitis A, and rotavirus are directly related to\ncontamination from human feces. Recent outbreaks have also shown that these\nviruses may be transmitted via droplets in the air. In limited cases, foodborne viruses\nmay occur in raw commodities contaminated by human feces (e.g., shellfish harvested\nfrom unapproved, polluted waters). In most cases, however, contamination of food by\nviruses is the result of cross-contamination by ill food employees or unclean equipment\nand utensils. Unlike bacteria, a virus cannot multiply outside of a living cell. Cooking as\na control for viruses may be ineffective because many foodborne viruses seem to\nexhibit heat resistance exceeding cooking temperature requirements, under laboratory\nconditions. Obtaining food from approved sources, practicing no bare hand contact\nwith ready-to-eat food as well as proper handwashing, and implementing an employee\nhealth policy to restrict or exclude ill employees are important control measures for\nviruses.\nParasites are most often animal host-specific, but can include humans in their life\ncycles. Parasitic infections are commonly associated with undercooking meat products\nor cross-contamination of ready-to-eat food with raw animal foods, untreated water, or\ncontaminated equipment or utensils. Like viruses, parasites do not grow in food, so\ncontrol is focused on destroying the parasites and/or preventing their introduction.\nAdequate cooking destroys parasites. In addition, parasites in fish to be consumed raw\nor undercooked can also be destroyed by effective freezing techniques. Parasitic\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\ncontamination by ill employees can be prevented by proper handwashing, no bare hand\ncontact with ready-to-eat food, and implementation of an employee health policy to\nrestrict or exclude ill employees.\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\nAnnex 4, Table 1a \u2013 1c.

High levels of toxic chemicals may cause acute cases of foodborne illness, while\nchronic illness may result from low levels.\nThe Code of Federal Regulations (http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/cfr-tablesearch.html), Title 21 Food and Drugs, provides guidance on naturally occurring\npoisonous or deleterious substances, e.g., 21 CFR Parts 109 Unavoidable\nContaminants in Food for Human Consumption and Food Packaging Material, and 184\nDirect Food Substances Affirmed as Generally Recognized as Safe. The CFR also\nprovide allowable limits for many of the chemicals added during processing, e.g., 21\nCFR Part 172 Food Additives Permitted for Direct Addition to Food For Human\nConsumption.\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors",

A food allergy is caused by a naturally-occurring protein in a food or a food\ningredient, which is referred to as an \u201callergen.\u201d For unknown reasons, certain\nindividuals produce immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies specifically directed to food\nallergens. When these sensitive individuals ingest sufficient concentrations of foods\ncontaining these allergens, the allergenic proteins interact with IgE antibodies and elicit\nan abnormal immune response. A food allergic response is commonly characterized by\nhives or other itchy rashes, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting and/or diarrhea,\nwheezing, shortness of breath, and swelling of various parts of the body. In severe\ncases, anaphylactic shock and death may result.\nMany foods, with or without identifiable allergens, have been reported to cause food\nallergies. However, FDA believes there is scientific consensus that the following foods\ncan cause a serious allergic reaction in sensitive individuals; these foods account for\n90% or more of all food allergies:\n\u2022 Milk\n\u2022 Egg\n\u2022 Fish (such as bass, flounder, or cod)\n\u2022 Crustacean shellfish (such as crab, lobster, or shrimp)\n\u2022 Tree nuts (such as almonds, pecans, or walnuts)\n\u2022 Wheat\n\u2022 Peanuts\n\u2022 Soybeans.\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\nConsumers with food allergies rely heavily on information contained on food labels to\navoid food allergens. Each year, FDA receives reports from consumers who have\nexperienced an adverse reaction following exposure to a food allergen. Frequently,\nthese reactions occur either because product labeling does not inform the consumer of\nthe presence of the allergenic ingredient in the food or because of the cross-contact of\na food with an allergenic substance not intended as an ingredient of the food during\nprocessing and preparation.\nIn August 2004, the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law\n108-282, Title II) was enacted, which defines the term \u201cmajor food allergen.\u201d The\ndefinition of \u201cmajor food allergen\u201d adopted for use in the Food Code (see paragraph\n1-201.10(B)) is consistent with the definition in the new law. The following requirements\nare included in the new law:\n\u2022\t For foods labeled on or after 2006-01-01, food manufacturers must identify\nin plain language on the label of the food any major food allergen used as an\ningredient in the food, including a coloring, flavoring, or incidental additive.\n\u2022\t FDA is to conduct inspections to ensure that food facilities comply with practices\nto reduce or eliminate cross-contact of a food with any major food allergens that\nare not intentional ingredients of the food.\n\u2022\t Within 18 months of the date of enactment of the new law (i.e., by 2006-02-02), FDA must submit a report to Congress that analyzes the results of its food\ninspection findings and addresses a number of specific issues related to the\nproduction, labeling, and recall of foods that contain an undeclared major food\nallergen.\n\u2022\t Within 2 years of the date of enactment of the new law (i.e., by 2006-08-02),\nFDA must issue a proposed rule, and within 4 years of the date of enactment of\nthe new law (i.e., by 2008-08-02), FDA must issue a final rule to define and\npermit the use of the term \u201cgluten-free\u201d on food labeling.\n\u2022\t FDA is to work in cooperation with the Conference for Food Protection (CFP) to\npursue revision of the Food Code to provide guidelines for preparing allergenfree foods in food establishments.\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\nAnnex 4, Table 2a-b.

These physical hazards can\nresult from contamination or poor procedures at many points in the food chain from\nharvest to consumer, including those within the food establishment. As establishments\ndevelop their food safety management systems, Annex 4, Table 3 can be used to aid in\nthe identification of sources of potential physical hazards to the food being prepared,\nserved, or sold. Annex 4, Table 3 provides some examples of common physical\nhazards.\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\nAnnex 4, Table 3.

Chapman\n& Hall, New York, NY.\n(6) What is the purpose of the hazard analysis principle?\nThe purpose of hazard analysis is to develop a list of food safety hazards that are\nreasonably likely to cause illness or injury if not effectively controlled.\n(7) How is the hazard analysis conducted?\nThe process of conducting a hazard analysis involves two stages:\n\n1. Hazard Identification\n2. Hazard Evaluation\nHazard identification can be thought of as a brain storming session. This stage focuses\non identifying the food safety hazards that might be present in the food given the food\npreparation process used, the handling of the food, the facility, and general\ncharacteristics of the food itself. During this stage, a review is made of the ingredients\nused in the product, the activities conducted at each step in the process, the equipment\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\nused, the final product, and its method of storage and distribution, as well as the\nintended use and consumers of the product.\n\nBased on this review, a list of potential biological, chemical, or physical hazards is\n\nmade at each stage in the food preparation process.\n\nIn stage two, the hazard evaluation, each potential hazard is evaluated based on the\nseverity of the potential hazard and its likely occurrence. The purpose of this stage is to\ndetermine which of the potential hazards listed in stage one of the hazard analysis\n\nwarrant control in the HACCP plan. Severity is the seriousness of the consequences of\n\nexposure to the hazard. Considerations made when determining the severity of a\nhazard include understanding the impact of the medical condition caused by the illness,\n\nas well as the magnitude and duration of the illness or injury. Consideration of the likely\n\noccurrence is usually based upon a combination of experience, epidemiological data,\n\nand information in the technical literature. Hazards that are not reasonably likely to\noccur are not considered in a HACCP plan. During the evaluation of each potential\n\nhazard, the food, its method of preparation, transportation, storage, and persons likely\n\nto consume the product should be considered to determine how each of these factors\n\nmay influence the likely occurrence and severity of the hazard being controlled.\n\nUpon completion of the hazard analysis, a list of significant hazards that must be\nconsidered in the HACCP plan is made, along with any measure(s) that can be used to\ncontrol the hazards. These measures, called control measures, are actions or activities\n\nthat can be used to prevent, eliminate, or reduce a hazard. Some control measures are\nnot essential to food safety, while others are. Control measures essential to food safety\n\nlike proper cooking, cooling, and refrigeration of ready-to-eat, time/temperature control\n\nfor safety foods are usually applied at critical control points (CCPs) in the HACCP plan\n(discussed later). The term control measure is used because not all hazards can be\nprevented, but virtually all can be controlled. More than one control measure may be\nrequired for a specific hazard. Likewise, more than one hazard may be addressed by a\nspecific control measure (e.g., proper cooking).",

    "content": "Likewise, more than one hazard may be addressed by a\nspecific control measure (e.g., proper cooking).\n\n(B) Principle #2: Determine Critical Control Points (CCPs)\n(1) What is the Critical Control Point (CCP)?\nA critical control point (CCP) means a point or procedure in a specific food system\nwhere loss of control may result in an unacceptable health risk. Control can be applied\nat this point and is essential to prevent or eliminate a food safety hazard or reduce it to\nan acceptable level. Each CCP will have one or more control measures to assure that\nthe identified hazards are prevented, eliminated, or reduced to acceptable levels.\nCommon examples of CCPs include cooking, cooling, hot holding, and cold holding of\nready-to-eat time/temperature control for safety foods. Due to vegetative and sporeand toxin-forming bacteria that are associated with raw animal foods, it is apparent that\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\nthe proper execution of control measures at each of these operational steps is essential\nto prevent or eliminate food safety hazards or reduce them to acceptable levels.\n(2) Are quality issues considered when determining CCPs?\nCCPs are only used to address issues with product safety. Actions taken on the part of\nthe establishment such as first-in first-out (FIFO) or refrigerating non-time/temperature\ncontrol for safety foods are to ensure food quality rather than food safety and therefore\nshould not be considered as CCPs unless they serve a dual-purpose of ensuring food\nsafety.\n(3) Are the CCPs the same for everyone?\nDifferent facilities preparing similar food items may identify different hazards and the\nCCPs. This can be due to differences in each facility's layout, equipment, selection of\ningredients, and processes employed. In mandatory HACCP systems, there may be\nrigid regulatory requirements regarding what must be designated a CCP. In voluntary\nHACCP systems, hazard control may be accomplished at CCPs or through prerequisite\nprograms. For instance, one facility may decide that it can best manage the hazards\nassociated with cooling through a standardized procedure in its prerequisite programs\nrather than at a CCP in its HACCP plan. One tool that can be used to assist each\nfacility in the identification of CCPs unique to its operation is a CCP decision tree.\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\nAnnex 4 \u2013 CCP Decision Tree 1\n* Decision tree adapted from NACMCF\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\n(C) Principle #3: Establish Critical Limits\n(1) What is a critical limit and what is its purpose?\nA critical limit is a prescribed parameter (e.g., minimum and/or maximum value) that\nmust be met to ensure that food safety hazards are controlled at each CCP. A critical\nlimit is used to distinguish between safe and unsafe operating conditions at a CCP.\nEach control measure at a CCP has one or more associated critical limits. Critical limits\nmay be based upon factors like temperature, time, moisture level, water activity (aw), or\npH. They must be scientifically-based and measurable.\n(2) What are examples of critical limits?\nExamples of critical limits are the time/temperature parameters for cooking chicken\n(165 o\nF for 15 seconds). In this case, the critical limit designates the minimum criteria\nrequired to eliminate food safety hazards or reduce them to an acceptable level. The\ncritical limit for the acidification of sushi rice, a pH of <4.6, sets the maximum limit for\npH necessary to control the growth of spore- and toxin-forming bacteria. Critical limits\nmay be derived from regulatory standards such as the FDA Food Code, other\napplicable guidelines, performance standards, or experimental results.\n(D) Principle #4: Establish Monitoring Procedures\n(1) What is the purpose of monitoring?\nMonitoring is the act of observing and making measurements to help determine if\ncritical limits are being met and maintained. It is used to determine whether the critical\nlimits that have been established for each CCP are being met.\n(2) What are examples of monitoring activities?\nExamples of monitoring activities include visual observations and measurements of\ntime, temperature, pH, and water activity. If cooking chicken is determined to be a CCP\nin an operation, then monitoring the internal temperature of a select number of chicken\npieces immediately following the cook step would be an example of a monitoring\nactivity. Alternatively, the temperature of an oven or fryer and the time required to\nreach an internal temperature of 165 o\nF could also be monitored.\n(3) How is monitoring conducted?\nTypically, monitoring activities fall under two broad categories:\n\u2022 measurements\n\n\u2022 observations\n\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\nMeasurements usually involve time and temperature but also include other parameters\nsuch as pH. If an operation identifies the acidification of sushi rice as a CCP and the\ncritical limit as the final pH of the product being < 4.6, then the pH of the product would\nbe measured to ensure that the critical limit is met.\nObservations involve visual inspections to monitor the presence or absence of a food\nsafety activity. If date marking is identified as a CCP in a deli operation for controlling\nListeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat deli meats, then the monitoring activity could\ninvolve making visual inspections of the date marking system to monitor the sell,\nconsume, or discard dates.\n(4) How often is monitoring conducted?\nMonitoring can be performed on a continuous or intermittent basis. Continuous\nmonitoring is always preferred when feasible as it provides the most complete\ninformation regarding the history of a product at a CCP. For example, the temperature\nand time for an institutional cook-chill operation can be recorded continuously on\ntemperature recording charts.\nIf intermittent monitoring is used, the frequency of monitoring should be conducted\noften enough to make sure that the critical limits are being met.\n(5) Who conducts monitoring?\nIndividuals directly associated with the operation (e.g., the person in charge of the\nestablishment, chefs, and departmental supervisors) are often selected to monitor\nCCPs. They are usually in the best position to detect deviations and take corrective\nactions when necessary. These employees should be properly trained in the specific\nmonitoring techniques and procedures used.\n(E) Principle #5: Establish Corrective Actions\n(1) What are corrective actions?\nCorrective actions are activities that are taken by a person whenever a critical limit is\nnot met. Discarding food that may pose an unacceptable food safety risk to consumers\nis a corrective action. However, other corrective actions such as further cooking or\nreheating a product can be used provided food safety is not compromised. For\nexample, a restaurant may be able to continue cooking hamburgers that have not\nreached an internal temperature of 155 o\nF for 15 seconds until the proper temperature\nis met. Clear instructions should be developed detailing who is responsible for\nperforming the corrective actions, the procedures to be followed, and when.\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors",

Clear instructions should be\ndeveloped detailing who is responsible for conducting verification, the frequency of\nverification, and the procedures used.\n(2)\t What is the frequency of verification activities?

Records provide documentation that appropriate corrective actions\nwere taken when critical limits were not met. In the event that an establishment is\nimplicated in a foodborne illness, documentation of activities related to monitoring and\ncorrective actions can provide proof that reasonable care was exercised in the\noperation of the establishment. Documenting activities provides a mechanism for\nverifying that the activities in the HACCP plan were properly completed. In many cases,\nrecords can serve a dual purpose of ensuring quality and food safety.\n(2)\t What types of records are maintained as part of a food safety management\nsystem?\nThere are at least 5 types of records that could be maintained to support a food safety\nmanagement system:\n\u2022 records documenting the activities related to the prerequisite programs\n\u2022 monitoring records\n\u2022 corrective action records\n\u2022 verification and validation records\n\u2022 calibration records.\n\n4. THE PROCESS APPROACH \u2013 A PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF HACCP AT\nRETAIL TO ACHIEVE ACTIVE MANAGERIAL CONTROL\n(A)\t Why Focus on HACCP Principles at Retail and Food Service?\nFDA recognizes that there are important differences between using HACCP principles\nin a food safety management system developed for food manufacturing plants and\napplying these same principles in food safety management system developed for use in\nretail and food service establishments.\nSince the 1980\u2019s, operators and regulators have been exploring the use of the HACCP\nprinciples in restaurants, grocery stores, institutional care facilities, and other retail food\nestablishments. During this time, much has been learned about how these principles\ncan be used in these varied operations, collectively referred to as retail food\nestablishments. Most of this exploration has centered around the focal question of how\nto stay true to the NACMCF definitions of HACCP and still make the principles useful to\nan industry that encompasses the broadest range of conditions.\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\nUnlike industries such as canning, other food processing, and dairy plants, the retail\nindustry is not easily defined by specific commodities or conditions. Consider the\nfollowing characteristics that retail food establishments share that set them apart from\nmost food processors:\n\n1. Employee and management turnover is exceptionally high in food\nestablishments, especially for entry level positions. This means the many\nemployees or managers have little experience and food safety training must be\ncontinuously provided.\n\n2. Many establishments are start-up businesses operating without benefit of a large\ncorporate support structure and having a relatively low profit margin and perhaps\nless capital to work with than other segments of the food industry.\n\n3. There is an almost endless number of production techniques, products, menu\nitems, and ingredients used which are not easily adapted to a simple,\nstandardized approach. Changes occur frequently and little preparation time is\navailable.\nFDA fully recognizes the diversity of retail and food service establishments and their\nvarying in-house resources to implement HACCP. That recognition is combined with an\nunderstanding that the success of such implementation is dependent upon establishing\nrealistic and useful food safety strategies that are customized to the operation.\n(B) What is the Process Approach?\nWhen conducting the hazard analysis, food manufacturers usually use food\ncommodities as an organizational tool and follow the flow of each product. This is a\nvery useful approach for producers or processors since they are usually handling one\nproduct at a time. By contrast, in retail and food service operations, foods of all types\nare worked together to produce the final product. This makes a different approach to\nthe hazard analysis necessary. Conducting the hazard analysis by using the food\npreparation processes common to a specific operation is often more efficient and useful\nfor retail and food service operators. This is called the \"process approach\" to HACCP.\nThe process approach can best be described as dividing the many food flows in an\nestablishment into broad categories based on activities or stages in the preparation of\nthe food, then analyzing the hazards, and placing managerial controls on each\ngrouping.\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\n(C)\t What are the three food preparation processes most often used in retail\nand food service establishments and how are they determined?\nThe flow of food in a retail or food service establishment is the path that food follows\n\nfrom receiving through service or sale to the consumer. Several activities or stages\n\nmake up the flow of food and are called operational steps.\n\nExamples of operational steps include receiving, storing, preparing, cooking, cooling,\n\nreheating, holding, assembling, packaging, serving, and selling. The terminology used\nfor operational steps may differ between food service and retail food store operations.\n\nMost food items produced in a retail or food service establishment can be categorized\ninto one of three preparation processes based on the number of times the food passes\n\nthrough the temperature danger zone between 41\u00b0F and 135\u00b0F:\n\n\u2022 Process 1: Food Preparation with No Cook Step\n\nExample flow: Receive \u2013 Store \u2013 Prepare \u2013 Hold \u2013 Serve",

For instance, quick service facilities\nmay have \u201ccook and serve\u201d processes specific to their operation. These processes are\nlikely to be different from the \u201cSame Day Service\u201d preparation processes in full service\nrestaurants since many of their foods are generally cooked and hot held before service.\nIn addition, in retail food stores, operational steps such as packaging and assembly\nmay be included in all of the food preparation processes before the product is sold to\nthe consumer. It is also very common for a retail or food service operator to use\nmultiple food preparation processes to create a single menu item.\n(D) How is a hazard analysis conducted in process HACCP?\nIn the process approach to HACCP, conducting a hazard analysis on individual food\nitems is time and labor intensive and is generally unnecessary. Identifying and\ncontrolling the hazards in each food preparation process achieves the same control of\nrisk factors as preparing a HACCP plan for each individual product.\nExample: An establishment has dozens of food items (including baked chicken and\nbaked meatloaf) in the \u201cPreparation for Same Day Service\u201d category. Each of the food\nitems may have unique hazards, but regardless of the individual hazards, control via\nproper cooking and holding will generally ensure the safety of all of the foods in this\ncategory. An illustration of this concept follows:\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\n\u2022\t Even though they have unique hazards, baked chicken and meatloaf are items\nfrequently grouped in the \u201cSame Day Service\u201d category (Process 2).\n\u2022\t Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter, as well as spore-formers, such as Bacillus\ncereus and Clostridium perfringens, are significant biological hazards in chicken.\n\u2022\t Significant biological hazards in meatloaf include Salmonella spp., E. coli\n\nO157:H7, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium perfringens.\n\n\u2022\t Despite their different hazards, the control measure used to kill pathogens in\nboth these products is cooking to the proper temperature.\n\u2022\t Additionally, if the products are held after cooking, then proper hot holding or\ntime control is also required to prevent the outgrowth of spore-formers that are\nnot destroyed by cooking.\nAs with product-specific HACCP, critical limits for cooking remain specific to each food\nitem in the process. In the scenario described above, the cooking step for chicken\nrequires a final internal temperature of 165\u00b0F for 15 seconds to control the pathogen\nload for Salmonella spp. Meatloaf, on the other hand, is a ground beef product and\nrequires a final internal temperature of 155\u00b0F for 15 seconds to control the pathogen\nload for both Salmonella spp. and E. coli O157:H7. Some operational steps such as\nrefrigerated storage or hot holding have critical limits that apply to all foods.\nAnnex 4, Table 4 further illustrates this concept. Note that the only unique control\nmeasure applies to the critical limit of the cooking step for each of the products. Other\nfood safety hazards and control measures may exist that are not depicted here:\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\nAnnex 4, Table 4: Examples of Hazards and Control Measures for Same Day\nService Items\nBaked Meatloaf (Process 2: Preparation for Same Day Service)\nExample Biological\nHazards Example Control Measures\nSalmonella spp. Refrigeration at 41o\nF or below\nE. coli O157:H7 Cooking at 155o\nF for 15 seconds\nClostridium perfringens Hot Holding at 135o\nF or above OR Time Control\nBacillus cereus Hot Holding at 135o\nF or above OR Time Control\nVarious fecal-oral route\npathogens\nGood personal hygiene (No bare hand contact with\nready-to-eat food, proper handwashing,\nexclusion/restriction of ill employees)\nBaked Chicken (Process 2: Preparation for Same Day Service)\nExample Biological\nHazards Example Control Measures\nSalmonella spp. Refrigeration at 41o\nF or below\nCampylobacter Cooking at 165o\nF for 15 seconds\nClostridium perfringens Hot Holding at 135o\nF or above OR Time Control\nBacillus cereus Hot Holding at 135o\nF or above OR Time Control\nVarious fecal-oral route\npathogens\nGood personal hygiene (No bare hand contact with\nready-to-eat food, proper handwashing,\nexclusion/restriction of ill employees)\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors",

Several of\nthe most common control measures associated with each food preparation process are\ndiscussed in this Annex. Retail or food service establishments should use these simple\ncontrol measures as the core of their food safety management systems; however, there\nmay be other risk factors unique to an operation or process that are not listed here.\nEach operation should be evaluated independently.\nIn developing a voluntary food safety management system, active managerial control of\nrisk factors common to each process can be achieved by implementing control\nmeasures at certain operational steps designated as critical control points (CCPs) or by\nimplementing prerequisite programs. This is explained in more detail in the Operator\u2019s\nManual discussed in Part 5 of this Annex.\n(F) Facility-wide Considerations\nIn order to have active managerial control over personal hygiene and crosscontamination, certain control measures must be implemented in all phases of the\noperation. All of the following control measures should be implemented regardless of\nthe food preparation process used:\n\u2022\t No bare hand contact with ready-to-eat foods (or use of a pre-approved,\nalternative procedure) to help prevent the transfer of viruses, bacteria, or\nparasites from hands to food\n\u2022\t Proper handwashing to help prevent the transfer of viruses, bacteria, or\n\nparasites from hands to food\n\n\u2022\t Restriction or exclusion of ill employees to help prevent the transfer of\n\nviruses, bacteria, or parasites from hands to food\n\n\u2022\t Prevention of cross-contamination of ready-to-eat food or clean and sanitized\nfood-contact surfaces with soiled cutting boards, utensils, aprons, etc., or raw\nanimal foods.\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\n(G) Food Preparation Process 1 \u2013 Food Preparation with No Cook Step\nExample Flow: RECEIVE STORE PREPARE HOLD SERVE\nSeveral food flows are represented by this particular process. Many of these food flows\nare common to both retail food stores and food service facilities, while others only apply\nto retail operations. Raw, ready-to-eat food like sashimi, raw oysters, and salads are\ngrouped in this category. Components of these foods are received raw and will not be\ncooked before consumption.\nFoods cooked at the processing level but that undergo no further cooking at the retail\nlevel before being consumed are also represented in this category. Examples of these\nkinds of foods are deli meats, cheeses, and other pasteurized dairy products (such as\nyogurt). In addition, foods that are received and sold raw but are to be cooked by the\nconsumer after purchase, e.g., hamburger meat, chicken, and steaks, are also included\nin this category.\nAll the foods in this category lack a cook step while at the retail or food service facility;\nthus, there are no complete trips through the danger zone. Purchase specifications can\nbe required by the retail or food service establishment to ensure that foods are received\nas safe as possible. Without a kill step to destroy pathogens, preventing further\ncontamination by ensuring that employees follow good hygienic practices is an\nimportant control measure.\nCross-contamination must be prevented by properly storing ready-to-eat food away\nfrom raw animal foods and soiled equipment and utensils. Foodborne illness may\nresult from ready-to-eat food being held at unsafe temperatures for long periods of time\ndue to the outgrowth of bacteria.\nIn addition to the facility-wide considerations, a food safety management system\ninvolving this food preparation process should focus on ensuring active managerial\ncontrol over the following:\n\u2022\t Cold holding or using time alone to control bacterial growth and toxin\nproduction\n\n\u2022\t Food source (e.g., shellfish due to concerns with viruses, natural toxins, and\nVibrio and for certain marine finfish intended for raw consumption due to\nconcerns with ciguatera toxin)\n\u2022\t Receiving temperatures (e.g., certain species of marine finfish due to concerns\nwith scombrotoxin)\n\u2022\t Date marking of ready-to-eat TCS food held for more than 24 hours to control\nthe growth of psychrophiles such as Listeria monocytogenes\n\u2022\t Freezing certain species of fish intended for raw consumption due to parasite\nconcerns\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\n\u2022\t Cooling from ambient temperature to prevent the outgrowth of spore-forming or\ntoxin-forming bacteria.\n(H) Food Preparation Process 2 \u2013 Preparation for Same Day Service\nExample Flow: RECEIVE STORE PREPARE COOK HOLD SERVE\nIn this food preparation process, food passes through the danger zone only once in the\nretail or food service facility before it is served or sold to the consumer. Food is usually\ncooked and held hot until served, e.g., fried chicken, but can also be cooked and\nserved immediately. In addition to the facility-wide considerations, a food safety\nmanagement system involving this food preparation process should focus on ensuring\nactive managerial control over the following:\n\u2022 Cooking to destroy bacteria and parasites\n\u2022\t Hot holding or using time alone to prevent the outgrowth of spore-forming\nbacteria.\nApproved food source, proper receiving temperatures, and proper cold holding before\ncooking would also be important if dealing with certain marine finfish due to concerns\nwith ciguatera toxin and scombrotoxin.\n(I) Food Preparation Process 3 \u2013 Complex Food Preparation\nExample Flow: RECEIVE STORE PREPARE COOK COOL REHEAT\nHOT HOLD SERVE\nFoods prepared in large volumes or in advance for next day service usually follow an\nextended process flow. These foods pass through the temperature danger zone more\nthan one time; thus, the potential for the growth of spore-forming or toxigenic bacteria is\ngreater in this process. Failure to adequately control food product temperatures is one\nof the most frequently encountered risk factors contributing to foodborne illness. Food\nhandlers should minimize the time foods are at unsafe temperatures.\nIn addition to the facility-wide considerations, a food safety management system\ninvolving this food preparation process should focus on ensuring active managerial\ncontrol over the following:\n\u2022 Cooking to destroy bacteria and parasites\n\u2022 Cooling to prevent the outgrowth of spore-forming or toxin-forming bacteria\n\u2022\t Hot and cold holding or using time alone to control bacterial growth and toxin\nformation\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors",

FDA RETAIL HACCP MANUALS\n(A)\t What guidance has been developed by FDA to assist operators of retail and\nfood service establishments in achieving active managerial control of\nfoodborne illness risk factors?\nFDA, in partnership with Federal, State, and local regulators, industry, academia, and\nconsumers, has written a guidance document entitled, \u201cManaging Food Safety: A\nManual for the Voluntary Use of HACCP Principles for Operators of Food Service and\nRetail Establishments.\u201d Commonly referred to as the \u201cOperator\u2019s Manual,\u201d this\ndocument is designed to assist operators with developing or enhancing food safety\nmanagement systems based on the process approach to HACCP. The manual\npresents a step-by-step procedure for writing and voluntarily implementing a food safety\nmanagement system based on the principles of HACCP. The desired outcome is an\noperator who employs a preventive rather than a reactive strategy to food safety.\nThe Operator\u2019s Manual embodies FDA\u2019s current thinking on the application of HACCP\nprinciples at retail. It advocates the voluntary use of HACCP principles using the\nprocess approach as a practical and effective means of reducing the occurrence of\nfoodborne illness risk factors leading to out-of-control hazards. The Operator\u2019s Manual\nis strictly for the voluntary implementation of HACCP principles at retail and should not\nbe used to develop HACCP plans that are required through Federal, State, or local\nregulations, ordinances, or laws. The document can be found on the FDA Web Page at\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/HACCP/ucm2006811.htm.\n(B)\t What guidance has been developed by FDA to assist regulators of retail and\nfood service establishments in assessing industry\u2019s active managerial\ncontrol of foodborne illness risk factors?\nFDA has written a document for regulators of retail and food service establishments\nentitled, \u201cManaging Food Safety: A Regulator\u2019s Manual for Applying HACCP Principles\nto Risk-Based Retail and Food Service Inspections and Evaluating Voluntary Food\nSafety Management Systems.\u201d Commonly referred to as the \u201cRegulator\u2019s Manual,\u201d this\ndocument was written to provide a risk-based inspectional \"roadmap\" for evaluating the\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\ndegree of active managerial control an operator has over foodborne illness risk factors.\nIn addition, the manual advocates the use of voluntary intervention strategies, including\nthe development of food safety management systems or risk control plans to bring\nabout a long-term behavior change that will result in a reduction in the occurrence of\nrisk factors. In cases where an operator may want their inspector to provide them with\nfeedback on their voluntarily-implemented food safety management system, the manual\nprovides regulators with information on how to validate and verify an existing system.\nThe document can be found on the FDA Web Page at:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/HACCP/ucm2006812.htm.\nAnnex 5 of the Food Code outlines the basis for conducting successful risk-based\ninspections and is provided to assist industry in achieving active managerial control of\nfoodborne illness risk factors as outlined in the draft Recommended National Retail\nFood Regulatory Program Standards and the Regulator\u2019s Manual.\n\n6. ADVANTAGES OF USING THE PRINCIPLES OF HACCP\n(A)\t What advantages does using HACCP principles offer operators of retail and\nfood service establishments?\nRather than relying solely on periodic feedback from inspections by regulatory\nagencies, an establishment operator who implements a food safety management\nsystem based on HACCP principles emphasizes continuous problem solving and\nprevention. Additionally, HACCP enhances and encourages communication between\nindustry and regulators.\nA food safety management system based on HACCP principles offers many other\nadvantages to industry. One advantage is that such a system may provide a method\nfor achieving active managerial control of multiple risk factors associated with an entire\noperation. Other advantages include:\n\u2022 Reduction in product loss\n\u2022 Increase in product quality\n\u2022 Better inventory control\n\u2022 Consistency in product preparation\n\u2022 Increase in profit\n\u2022 Increased employee awareness and participation in food safety.\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n\n(B)\t What advantages does using HACCP principles offer regulators of retail\nand food service establishments?\nTraditional inspections are relatively resource-intensive, inefficient, and reactive rather\nthan preventive in nature. Using traditional inspection techniques allows for a\nsatisfactory \u201csnapshot\u201d assessment of the requirements of the code at the time of the\ninspection. Unfortunately, unless an inspector asks questions and inquires about the\nactivities and procedures being utilized by the establishment even at times when the\ninspector is not there, there is no way to know if an operator is achieving active\nmanagerial control.\nWith the limited time often available for conducting inspections, regulators must focus\ntheir attention on those areas that clearly have the greatest impact on food safety \u2013\nfoodborne illness risk factors. By knowing that there are only a few control measures\nthat are essential to food safety and focusing on these during the inspection, an\ninspector can assess the operator\u2019s active managerial control of the foodborne illness\nrisk factors.\nRegulators can provide invaluable feedback to an operator through their routine\ninspections. This is especially useful when utilizing a risk-based approach. By\nincorporating HACCP principles into routine inspections, an inspector can provide an\noperator with the constructive input needed to establish the control system necessary to\nbring the foodborne illness risk factors back under continuous control.\n\n7. SUMMARY\nIn order to make a positive impact on foodborne illness, retail and food service\noperators must achieve active managerial control of the risk factors contributing to\nfoodborne illness. Combined with basic sanitation, employee training, and other\nprerequisite programs, the principles of HACCP provide an effective system for\nachieving this objective.\nThe goal in applying HACCP principles in retail and food service is to have the operator\ntake purposeful actions to ensure safe food. The process approach simplifies HACCP\nprinciples for use in retail and food service. This practical and effective method of\nhazard control embodies the concept of active managerial control by providing an ongoing system of simple control measures that will reduce the occurrence of risk factors\nthat lead to out-of-control hazards.\nAnnex 4 \u2013 Management of Food Safety Practices \u2013 Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors",

Various strategies that can be used by regulatory professionals\nto assist operators in achieving active managerial control of foodborne illness risk\nfactors are also included in this Annex.\nAs presented in Annex 4, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nSurveillance Report for 1993-1997, \u201cSurveillance for Foodborne Disease Outbreaks \u2013\nUnited States\u201d (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss4901a1.htm ) identifies\nthe most frequently reported contributing factors to foodborne illness. Five of these\nbroad categories of contributing factors directly relate to food safety concerns within\nretail and food service establishments and are collectively termed by the FDA as\n\u201cfoodborne illness risk factors.\u201d\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\nThese five broad categories are:\n\u2022 Food from Unsafe Sources\n\u2022 Inadequate Cooking\n\u2022 Improper Holding Temperatures\n\u2022 Contaminated Equipment\n\u2022 Poor Personal Hygiene.\nThe FDA manual, Managing Food Safety: A Regulator\u2019s Manual for Applying HACCP\nPrinciples to Risk-based Retail and Food Service Inspections and Evaluating Voluntary\nFood Safety Management Systems (FDA\u2019s Regulator\u2019s Manual)\n(http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/HACCP/ucm2006812.htm), provides\nadditional information on conducting risk-based inspections. Annex 4 of the Food Code\nprovides additional information on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP)\nprinciples and the process approach to HACCP. It should be reviewed in conjunction\nwith the material found in this Annex to better prepare for performing risk-based\ninspections.\nThe \"Retail Food Program Resource Guide,\" a CD-ROM containing pertinent FDA\ndocuments referenced in this Annex, is available for use by federal, state, local, and\ntribal regulatory agencies. It is produced by and available through FDA Regional Retail\nFood Specialists or the FDA Division of Federal-State Relations (HFC-150); U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration; 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 12-07; Rockville, Maryland 20857;\nPHONE (301) 827-6906; (FAX) (301) 443-2143.\n\n2. RISK-BASED ROUTINE INSPECTIONS\nInspections have been a part of food safety regulatory activities since the earliest days\nof public health. The term \"routine inspection\u201d has been used to describe periodic\ninspections conducted as part of an on-going regulatory scheme.\nProgram managers should strive to have adequate staffing and resources to allow all\ninspectors ample time to thoroughly evaluate establishments and ask as many\nquestions as needed to fully understand establishments\u2019 operations. For most\njurisdictions, however, inspectors continue to have limited time in which to complete\ninspections. This does not negate the need to thoroughly identify and assess the\ncontrol of foodborne illness risk factors during each inspection.\nIt is a false assumption that inspectors cannot conduct risk-based inspections in a\nlimited timeframe. Even with limited time, inspectors can focus their inspections on\nassessing the degree of active managerial control an operator has over the foodborne\nillness risk factors. By focusing inspections on the control of foodborne illness risk\nfactors, inspectors can be assured that they are making a great impact on reducing\nfoodborne illness.\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\nAs described in Annex 4, active managerial control means the purposeful incorporation\nof specific actions or procedures by industry management into the operation of their\nbusinesses to attain control over foodborne illness risk factors. It embodies a\npreventive rather than reactive approach to food safety through a continuous system of\nmonitoring and verification.\nDeveloping and implementing food safety management systems to prevent, eliminate,\nor reduce the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors is recommended to achieve\nactive managerial control. Regulatory inspections and follow-up activities must be\nproactive by using an inspection process designed to evaluate the implementation of\nFood Code interventions and the degree of active managerial control that retail and\nfoodservice operators have over foodborne illness risk factors. The five Food Code\ninterventions below were new interventions introduced with the 1993 Food Code and\nthey are just as important today as they were in 1993. They encompass a wide-range\nof control measures specifically designed to protect consumer health:\n\u2022 Demonstration of Knowledge\n\u2022 Implementation of Employee Health Policies\n\u2022 Hands as a Vehicle of Contamination\n\u2022 Time/Temperature Relationships\n\u2022 Consumer Advisory.\nWhen Food Code interventions are not being implemented or if behaviors, activities, or\nprocedures likely to cause foodborne illness are observed, inspectors should verify that\nthe operator takes immediate corrective action so that consumers do not become sick\nor injured. Observations made on the day of the inspection, as well as information\ngained about the behaviors, activities, and procedures that occur at other times, allow\ninspectors to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the food safety management\nsystem that is in place.\nAn operator should be made aware of the inspectional findings both during, and at the\nconclusion of, the inspection and strategies for achieving compliance in the future\nshould be discussed. Corrective actions taken during the inspection and repeat\nviolations should be noted on the inspection report. Repeat violations should trigger\nfurther compliance and enforcement actions.\nThe inspection process is also an opportunity to educate the operator on the public\nhealth reasons supporting the Code requirements. If operators are afforded the chance\nto ask questions about general food safety matters, they may clearly understand the\npublic health significance of non-compliance.\nLastly, if the operator demonstrates a history of violations related to foodborne illness\nrisk factors, the inspection process can be used to assist the operator with implementing\nlong-term control systems to prevent those risk factors from occurring in the future.\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections",

Schedule Inspections Based on Risk\nStudies have shown that the types of food served, the food preparation processes used,\nthe volume of food, and the population served all have a bearing on the occurrence of\nfoodborne illness risk factors in retail and foodservice establishments. Standard 3 of the\nProgram Standards requires that regulatory jurisdictions develop and use a process that\ngroups food establishments into at least three categories based on potential and\ninherent food safety risks. In addition, Standard 3 requires that regulatory jurisdictions\nassign inspection frequency based on the risk categories to focus program resources on\nfood operations with the greatest food safety risk. With limited resources, creating a\nvariable inspection frequency for each category will allow inspection staff to effectively\nspend more time in high risk establishments that pose the greatest potential risk of\ncausing foodborne illness.\nTable 1 of this Annex provides an example of risk categories and assignment of\ninspection frequency based on risk. In this example, the type of food served, food\npreparation processes conducted, and history of compliance related to foodborne illness\nrisk factors are used as the basis of categorizing risk. Each jurisdiction is encouraged\nto develop risk categories tailored to their specific program needs and resources and to\nreassess the risk categories on an annual basis.\nRegardless of the risk category initially assigned to food establishments, regulatory\njurisdictions sometimes consider whether the establishment has implemented a\nvoluntary food safety management system like HACCP, to justify a decrease in\ninspection frequency. Likewise, the following factors are among many that regulatory\njurisdictions sometimes use to justify an increase in inspection frequency:\n\u2022\t History of non-compliance with provisions related to foodborne illness risk factors\nor critical items\n\u2022\t Specialized processes conducted\n\u2022\t Food preparation a day in advance of service\n\u2022\t Large number of people served\n\u2022\t History of foodborne illness and/or complaints\n\u2022\t Highly susceptible population served.\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\nAnnex 5, Table 1. Risk Categorization of Food Establishments\nRISK\nCATEGORY DESCRIPTION\nFREQUENCY\n#/YR\nExamples include most convenience store operations, hot dog\ncarts, and coffee shops. Establishments that serve or sell only\npre-packaged, non- time/temperature control for safety (TCS)\nfoods. Establishments that prepare only non-TCS foods.\nEstablishments that heat only commercially processed, TCS\nfoods for hot holding. No cooling of TCS foods.\nEstablishments that would otherwise be grouped in Category 2\nbut have shown through historical documentation to have\nachieved active managerial control of foodborne illness risk\nfactors.\nExamples may include retail food store operations, schools not\nserving a highly susceptible population, and quick service\noperations. Limited menu. Most products are\nprepared/cooked and served immediately. May involve hot\nand cold holding of TCS foods after preparation or cooking.\nComplex preparation of TCS foods requiring cooking, cooling,\nand reheating for hot holding is limited to only a few TCS\nfoods. Establishments that would otherwise be grouped in\nCategory 3 but have shown through historical documentation\nto have achieved active managerial control of foodborne illness\nrisk factors. Newly permitted establishments that would\notherwise be grouped in Category 1 until history of active\nmanagerial control of foodborne illness risk factors is achieved\nand documented.\nAn example is a full service restaurant. Extensive menu and\nhandling of raw ingredients. Complex preparation including\ncooking, cooling, and reheating for hot holding involves many\nTCS foods. Variety of processes require hot and cold holding\nof TCS food. Establishments that would otherwise be grouped\nin Category 4 but have shown through historical documentation\nto have achieved active managerial control of foodborne illness\nrisk factors. Newly permitted establishments that would\notherwise be grouped in Category 2 until history of active\nmanagerial control of foodborne illness risk factors is achieved\nand documented.\nExamples include preschools, hospitals, SNFs, and\nestablishments conducting processing at retail. Includes\nestablishments serving a highly susceptible population or that\nconduct specialized processes, e.g., smoking and curing;\nreduced oxygen packaging for extended shelf-life.\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\nB. Have the Proper Equipment\nIn order to conduct risk-based inspections, each inspector must be provided with the\nproper equipment to assess the control of foodborne illness risk factors within food\nestablishments. See Program Standard 8 at\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/ProgramStandards/\ndefault.htm for recommendations of equipment needed by inspectors. At a minimum,\neach inspector should be provided with the following essential equipment:\n\u2022 Thermocouple with the appropriate probes for the food being tested\n\u2022 Alcohol swabs or other suitable equipment for sanitizing probe thermometers\n\u2022 Chemical test kits for different chemical sanitizer types\n\u2022 Heat-sensitive tape or maximum registering thermometer\n\u2022 Flashlight\n\u2022 Head cover, such as baseball cap, hair net, or equivalent.\nOther equipment may be provided to inspectors on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis. While it is\ndesirable for each inspector to have the following equipment, depending on the\nresources available to the agency, this equipment may be shared in a central office as\nappropriate:\n\u2022\t Pressure gauge for determining in-line pressure of hot water at injection point of\nwarewashing machine (5-30 psi)\n\u2022\t Light meter\n\u2022\t Measuring device for measuring distances\n\u2022\t Time/temperature data logger\n\u2022\t pH meter\n\u2022\t Water activity meter\n\u2022\t Camera\n\u2022\t Computers with or without an electronic inspection system\n\u2022\t Black light\n\u2022\t Foodborne illness investigation kits\n\u2022\t Sample collection kits\n\u2022\t Cell phones.\nC. Provide Adequate Training\nStandard 2 of the Program Standards explains that regulatory staff shall have the\nknowledge, skills, and ability to adequately perform their required duties. Inspectors\nneed the proper training before they can be expected to conduct risk-based inspections.\nTraining includes a combination of classroom training, in-field training, standardization,\nand continuing education. For specific training recommendations refer to Program\nStandard 2 at\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/ProgramStandards/\ndefault.htm and its accompanying Appendix B at the aforementioned website.\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections",

    "content": "Annex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\n(1) Classroom Training\nThe first phase of staff training should provide an orientation to the program with a\nreview of program history, structure, and relationships to other food-related programs.\nSpecific emphasis should be on the program's goals and objectives. The basic training\ncurriculum should include the following components:\n\u2022 Prevailing statutes, regulations, or ordinances\n\u2022 Public health principles\n\u2022 Communication skills\n\u2022 Epidemiology\n\u2022 Microbiology\n\u2022 HACCP.\nFDA\u2019s ORA-U\n(http://www.fda.gov/Training/ForStateLocalTribalRegulators/ucm121831.htm)\nprovides basic curriculum components free of charge to regulators via the internet. This\nallows state, local, and tribal health departments to conserve their time and funding\nresources instead of developing their own training courses. It also allows inspectors to\naccess training as needed. Distance learning allows government agencies and\nindustries to cost-effectively disseminate the most current technical and regulatory\ninformation on an as-needed basis.\n(2) Field Training and Experience\nThe second phase of training should move the new inspector into the field with a\ntraining officer. On-site training should focus on specific inspection tasks such as\ninterviewing, making observations, measuring conditions such as temperatures and\nsanitizer strength, assessing the control operators have over the foodborne illness risk\nfactors, ensuring implementation of Food Code interventions, and completing the\ninspection form. If an electronic database is used by the agency, training in its use\nshould be included in this phase.\nThe evaluation of food safety management systems based on HACCP principles should\nbe part of the field training experience. The trainee and the trainer should review\nestablishment menus, operations, recipes, and standard operating procedures.\nInspectors should be able to demonstrate proficiency in gathering information about the\nfood preparation processes, including accurate charting of the food flows and\ndetermination of the Critical Control Points (CCPs) and critical limits in an operation.\nThis part of the training should also include a familiarization with the compliance and\nenforcement protocol in place in the jurisdiction including recommendation of voluntary\nstrategies to prevent risk factor occurrence.\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\n(3) Standardization\nThe third part of staff training should include standardization. This process improves\nuniformity in the application and interpretation of applicable regulations, inspection\nmethodology, and report writing. The Program Standards recommend that staff\nconducting inspections undergo a standardization process similar to the one described\nin the FDA Procedures for Standardization and Certification of Retail Food Inspection/\nTraining Officers\n(http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/InspectionsQuality\nAssurance/ucm2006814.htm ). Standardization should be completed after the trainee\ncompletes classroom and field training.\n(4) Continuing Education\nThe training process for inspection staff should be continuous. The final phase of\ntraining should include a mechanism to ensure that learning is ongoing and staff is kept\nabreast of food safety issues and the latest science.\nD. Ensure Adequate Program Resources\nAs indicated in Standard 8 of the Program Standards, regulatory agencies should have\nadequate funding, staff, and equipment necessary to support a risk-based retail food\nsafety program designed to reduce the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors.\nProgram management should do everything they can to secure funding and resources\nto support regulatory food programs.\nStandard 8 of the Program Standards also states that the program budget should\nprovide the necessary resources to develop and maintain a retail food safety program\nthat has a staffing level of one full-time equivalent (FTE) devoted to food for every 280 \u00ad\n320 inspections performed. Inspections, for purposes of this calculation, include routine\ninspections, re-inspections, complaint investigations, outbreak investigations,\ncompliance follow-up inspections, risk assessment reviews, process reviews, variance\nprocess reviews, and other direct establishment contact time such as on-site training.\n\n4. RISK-BASED INSPECTION METHODOLOGY\nA. Focus the Inspection\nConducting a risk-based inspection requires inspectors to focus their efforts on\nevaluating the degree of active managerial control that operators have over foodborne\nillness risk factors. In addition, it is essential that the implementation of Food Code\ninterventions also be verified during each inspection. Inspectors need to spend the\nmajority of their time observing the behaviors, practices, and procedures that are likely\nto lead to out-of-control foodborne illness risk factors and asking management and food\nemployees questions to supplement actual observations.\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\nRetail and food service operators implement \u201ccontrol measures\u201d to ensure food safety.\nControl measures are actions or activities that are used to prevent, eliminate, or reduce\nfood safety hazards. Inspectors need to determine the control measures that should be\nimplemented to prevent the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors in each food\npreparation process. In order to determine the foodborne illness risk factors common to\neach operation, it is important for inspectors to understand that the food preparation\nprocesses and all the associated control measures initiated by a retail or food service\noperator represent a food safety management system. It will be necessary for\ninspectors to ask questions in order to gain information about the system already in\nplace. Once the degree of active managerial control is determined, inspectors will be\nable to assist operators with strengthening their existing food safety management\nsystems.\nB. Lead by Example\nNonverbal communication is just as important as verbal communication in relaying\nimportant food safety principles to retail and food service operators. By setting the\nexample during inspections, inspectors not only demonstrate competency, but they also\nrelay important food safety information to the person in charge and food employees.\nThe following are ways that inspectors set the example during inspections:\n\u2022\t Washing their hands when entering the food preparation area at the beginning\nof the inspection and after engaging in any activities that might contaminate\ntheir hands\n\u2022\t Not working when they are suffering from symptoms such as diarrhea, fever,\nvomiting, or jaundice or if they are diagnosed with a disease transmittable by\nfood\n\u2022\t Being careful not to touch ready-to-eat (RTE) food with their bare hands\n\u2022\t Washing and sanitizing their thermocouple probe at the start of the inspection\nand between foods\n\u2022\t Using a proper hair restraint and practicing good personal hygiene\n\u2022\t Being careful not to contaminate clean and sanitized food contact-surfaces\nwith unclean hands or their inspection equipment.\nC. Conduct Inspections at Variable Times\nInspectors should enter the food establishment during hours of operation or at other\nreasonable times. Inspectors should show identification and provide the permit holder\nor person in charge with a verbal or written notice of the purpose of the inspection.\nProcedures outlined in the Food Code and in the jurisdiction\u2019s procedures should be\nfollowed if access to conduct an inspection is denied. Refusal should be documented\non the inspection report and an administrative or judicial inspection order obtained.\nIn planning for inspections, inspectors should consider the importance of timing.\nSeveral operational steps at retail such as receiving, preparation, and cooling can be\nevaluated only during limited time periods. In order to properly evaluate critical\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\nprocesses that occur outside of the normal 8 a.",

    "content": "processes that occur outside of the normal 8 a.\n\nm. to 5 p.\n\nm. working hours, an inspector\nshould be allowed the flexibility to conduct inspections early in the morning, late in the\nevening, and even on weekends.\nD. Establish Inspection Priorities and Use Inspection Time Wisely\nWith the limited time allotted for inspections, inspectors must develop clear priorities to\nmake the most efficient use of their time in each food establishment. Although basic\nsanitation issues generally do not change during the course of an inspection, critical\nbehaviors, practices, and procedures leading to foodborne illness risk factors may be\nonly observable during limited time periods of the preparation or cooling process. For\nthis reason, assessment of the active managerial control of foodborne illness risk\nfactors should generally be performed before reviewing basic sanitation issues.\nTo effectively set priorities, the following four activities should be completed early in the\ninspection:\n(1) Establish an open dialogue with the person in charge\n(2) Review previous inspection records\n(3) Conduct a menu or food list review\n(4) Conduct a quick walk-though.\n(1) Establish an Open Dialogue with the Person in Charge\nThe tone of the inspection is often set during the first few minutes of the inspection.\nA professional but personable approach is the balance which should be maintained.\nGenuine interest in the food establishment and the staff translates into good relations\nwhich may be helpful in conveying the goal of promoting public health. Having an open\ndialogue with the person in charge during all phases of the inspection gives inspectors\nan opportunity to learn important information about the existing food safety\nmanagement system.\nIt is important to know both the strengths and weaknesses of the existing food safety\nmanagement system early in the inspection in order to focus the inspection on weak\nareas. Questions about practices and procedures related to foodborne illness risk\nfactors and Food Code interventions such as the establishment\u2019s employee health\npolicy and consumer advisory notice should be asked during all phases of the\ninspection. It is important to ask enough questions to fully understand the system being\nutilized in the food establishment. This is especially true when evaluating whether the\nemployees are adhering to the established no bare hand contact and handwashing\npolicies. Asking the person in charge questions about important activities such as\nreceiving, cooling, and preparation is also important in relaying the importance of out-ofcontrol foodborne illness risk factors.\nThe person in charge should be encouraged to accompany inspectors during the\ninspection. This may ultimately save time since violations can be pointed out and\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\ncorrected as they are observed. In addition, the importance of violations related to\nfoodborne illness risk factors and Food Code interventions is more apparent if they are\npointed out during the inspection rather than waiting until the end. Violations should be\nmarked on the inspection form even if immediate corrective actions are taken.\nCorrective actions taken should also be recorded on the inspection form. Inspectors\ncan also use this time to share knowledge about critical processes. By communicating\nthe public health rationale behind the regulations, inspectors will leave the person in\ncharge with a clear understanding for why active managerial control of foodborne illness\nrisk factors must be a top priority in the day-to-day operation of the business.\nEarly in the inspection, inspectors should inquire about activities that are presently\noccurring. Processes that occur over time like cooling and reheating also need to be\nassessed over time; thus, inspectors should ask in the beginning of the inspection if any\nfoods are currently being cooled or reheated.\nIt is important for inspectors to allow the operator a chance to discuss issues related to\nfood safety. One-way communication in which inspectors do all the talking is not\nconducive to a risk-based philosophy. An effective risk-based inspection is dependent\non inspectors\u2019 ability to maintain two-way communication in order to properly assess\nbehaviors, processes, and procedures that occur in the food establishment.\n(2) Review Previous Inspection Reports\nIn order to detect trends of out-of-control foodborne illness risk factors, it is important for\ninspectors to review past inspection reports before conducting an inspection. This can\nbe done in the office or on-site in the food establishment. This activity is especially\nimportant in jurisdictions where inspectors rotate from one inspection to the next. If the\nsame foodborne illness risk factor is out-of-control during more than one inspection, it is\nstrongly recommended that the operator develop an intervention strategy to prevent its\nrecurrence. Intervention strategies are discussed later in this Annex.\nKnowledge of what has been corrected from the last inspection also gives inspectors an\nopportunity to provide positive feedback to the operator and allows inspectors to track\ncorrected violations in accordance with their jurisdiction\u2019s policies and procedures.\n(3) Conduct a Menu/Food List Review\nMenus, including all written and verbal lists of foods prepared and offered in a food\nestablishment, can be reviewed in a fairly simple manner. The review can either be\ndone simultaneously with a quick walk-through of the operation or at the beginning of\nthe inspection as a discussion with management. The menu/food list also does not\nneed to be reviewed during every inspection. If a review was done during a recent\ninspection, inspectors should inquire about new items, seasonal items, substitutions, or\nchanges in preparation since the last menu review was conducted.\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections",

    "content": "Annex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\nA review of the menu/food list allows inspectors to begin to group food items into one of\nthree broad process categories (discussed in Annex 4 of the Food Code and later in this\nAnnex). Mentally grouping products by process assists inspectors in focusing the\ninspection on the control measures critical to each process. Conducting a review of the\nmenu/food list also allows inspectors to establish inspection priorities by identifying:\n\u2022\t High-risk foods or high-risk food preparation processes\n\u2022\t Operational steps requiring further inquiry such as receiving, preparation,\ncooking, and cooling.\nBy identifying high-risk foods or high-risk food preparation processes, inspectors can\nfocus the inspection on those foods or processes that are more likely to cause\nfoodborne illness if uncontrolled. The menu/food list review might be the only time\ninspectors are made aware of specialized processes such as formulating a food so that\nit is not time/temperature control for safety food (TCS) or high-risk seasonal menu items\nsuch as \u201craw oysters on the half shell.\u201d Foods such as shellstock and certain fish for\nraw consumption require documentation that should be reviewed during the inspection.\nIf Caesar salad or hollandaise sauce is served, further inquiry is needed regarding the\npreparation of these items since they are sometimes prepared with raw or undercooked\neggs.\nSeveral operational steps like receiving, preparation, cooking, and cooling may not be\ninspected as vigorously in retail and food service inspections due, in part, to the hours\nof the day in which these steps occur. If a food establishment is inspected in the\nafternoon hours, for example, receiving and food preparation might have already\noccurred. In order to evaluate the establishment\u2019s active managerial control of\nfoodborne illness risk factors, it is imperative that inspectors ask enough questions to\nobtain information about the operational steps that they cannot directly observe during\nthe current inspection.\n(4) Conduct a Quick Walk-through\nAs inspectors discuss the menu or food list and establishes open communication with\nthe person in charge, it is suggested that they conduct a quick walk-through of the food\nestablishment to observe what is going on at that time. Conducting a quick walkthrough is especially important to observe several activities that might otherwise go\nunnoticed or unobserved until later in the inspection, including:\n\u2022\t Receiving\n\u2022\t Food preparation and handling\n\u2022\t Cooking\n\u2022\t Cooling\n\u2022\t Reheating.\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\nSpeaking directly to the food service employees preparing the food is also an excellent\nway to assess the effectiveness of the establishment\u2019s food safety training and standard\noperating procedures for critical processes such as cooling. Noting that receiving or\nfood preparation is occurring at the beginning of the inspection allows inspectors an\nopportunity to take advantage of viewing \u201creal-life\u201d production processes and will help\ninspectors to obtain a clear picture of the establishment's true practices. Receiving and\nfood preparation only occur during limited times, so inspectors may want to stop and\nobserve these operational steps while they are happening.\nEarly in the inspection, temperatures of time/temperature control for safety foods (TCS)\nshould be taken. For example, if inspecting in the morning, inspectors should check the\ntemperatures of last night\u2019s stored leftovers. If inspecting in the afternoon, inspectors\nshould check the temperatures of foods prepared that morning that are now cooling.\nAlso, inspectors should ask whether any foods are currently being cooked or reheated.\nE. Determine Process Flows\nMany retail and food service establishments have implemented effective food safety\nmanagement systems by establishing controls for the food preparation methods and\nprocesses common to their operation. Control of food preparation processes rather\nthan individual food items is often called the \u201cprocess approach\u201d to HACCP. The\nprocess approach using the principles of HACCP can best be described as dividing the\nmany food items in an operation into food preparation processes then analyzing the\nfoodborne illness risk factors associated with each process. By placing managerial\ncontrols on specific operational steps in the flow of food, foodborne illness can be\nprevented.\nAs presented in Annex 4 of the Food Code, most food items produced in a retail or food\nservice establishment can be categorized into one of three preparation processes\nbased on the number of times the food passes through the temperature danger zone\nbetween 41o F and 135o F. In conducting risk-based inspections, it is necessary for an\ninspector to be knowledgeable regarding how food is prepared in the operation.\nKnowing how products are prepared in an establishment allows inspectors to focus their\ninspections on the critical procedures and steps in the preparation of those products.\nF. Determine Foodborne Illness Risk Factors In Process Flows\nAnnex 4 of the Food Code details the essential control measures specific to each food\npreparation process, in addition to essential facility-wide control measures. Inspectors\nshould generally focus their inspections on verifying that operators have implemented\ncontrol measures to control for foodborne illness risk factors common to the processes\nconducted in each operation. There may be other foodborne illness risk factors unique\nto specific operations; thus, inspectors should independently evaluate each operation\nand food preparation process conducted.\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections",

    "content": "Annex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\nG.\t Assess Active Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors and\nImplementation of Food Code Interventions\nAlthough some food establishments have formal HACCP plans, many do not. Even\nwithout a HACCP system, every food establishment needs to have active managerial\ncontrol of foodborne illness risk factors. This may be achieved through several means,\nsuch as training programs, manager oversight, or standard operating procedures. For\nexample, some food establishments incorporate control measures into individual\nrecipes, production schedules, or employee job descriptions to achieve active\nmanagerial control.\nWhile a person in charge may require the maintenance of in-house written records by\nemployees to ensure that monitoring is being performed using the correct method and\nat the proper frequency, foodborne illness risk factors may be managed without the use\nof formal record keeping. Monitoring, whether through direct observations or by taking\nappropriate measurements, is by far the most important step in ensuring food safety. If\nan operator is effectively monitoring all critical activities in the food establishment and\ntaking corrective actions when needed, safe food will result. With a few exceptions,\nmaintaining formal records at retail is not required; therefore, records may not be in\nplace for use during the inspection. As a result, it will be necessary to use direct\nobservations and interviewing to determine whether a food establishment is adequately\nmonitoring foodborne illness risk factors in their existing food safety management\nsystem.\nThis section provides a comprehensive discussion of how to assess the active\nmanagerial control of each of the foodborne illness risk factors and the implementation\nof each of the Food Code interventions. Assessment of active managerial control\ninvolves more than determining compliance with Food Code provisions. In assessing\nwhether the operator has active managerial control, inspectors should observe whether\nthe operator has established the appropriate control measures and critical limits and\nwhether appropriate monitoring and corrective action procedures are in place and\nfollowed. In addition, inspectors should assess whether managers and employees are\nknowledgeable of food safety principles and critical practices and procedures necessary\nto prevent foodborne illness. If during the inspection inspectors observes that control\nmeasures are not being implemented appropriately to control risk factor occurrence,\nimmediate corrective action must be taken.\n(1)\t Demonstration of Knowledge\nIt is the responsibility of the person in charge to ensure compliance with the Code.\nKnowledge and application of Food Code provisions are vital to preventing foodborne\nillness and injury. Data collected by FDA suggest that having a certified food manager\non-site has a positive effect on the occurrence of certain foodborne illness risk factors in\nthe industry.\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\nIn order to assess whether the person in charge demonstrates knowledge, inspectors\nshould verify that the person in charge has one or more of the following:\n\u2022\t A valid food protection manager certificate\n\u2022\t No priority item violations during the current inspection\n\u2022\t Correct responses to food safety related questions as presented in\n\u00b6 2-102.11(C) of the Food Code.\n(2)\t Assessing Safe Sources and Receiving Temperatures\nThe time and day of the inspection is important when assessing whether foods are\nreceived from safe sources and in sound condition. Foods may be received in the food\nestablishment on set days. Inspectors should ask questions to ascertain the day or\ndays that deliveries are received and also the receiving procedures in place by the food\nestablishment. Inspections can be scheduled at times when it is known that products\nwill be received by the food establishment. If food is being delivered during the\ninspection, inspectors should:\n\u2022\t Verify internal product temperatures\n\u2022\t Examine package integrity upon delivery\n\u2022\t Look for signs of temperature abuse (e.g., large ice crystals in the packages\nof frozen products)\n\u2022\t Examine delivery truck and products for potential for cross-contamination\n\u2022\t Observe the food establishment\u2019s behaviors and practices as they relate to\nthe establishment\u2019s control of contamination and holding and cooling\ntemperatures of received products\n\u2022\t Review receiving logs and other documents, product labels, and food\nproducts to ensure that foods are received from regulated food processing\nplants (no foods prepared at home) and at the proper temperature.\nWhen evaluating approved sources for shellfish, such as clams, oysters, and mussels,\ninspectors should ask whether shellfish are served at any time during the year. If so,\ninspectors should review the tags or labels to verify that the supplier of the shellfish is\ncertified and on the most current Interstate Certified Shellfish Shippers List found at\n(http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/FederalStateFoodPrograms/ucm200675\n3.htm ). Inspectors should note whether all required information is provided on the tags\nor label (harvester\u2019s certification number, harvest waters and date, type and quantity of\nshellfish and similar information for each dealer that handles the shellfish after the\nharvester). Shellstock tags should also be retained for 90 days in chronological order.\nWith regard to fish, inspectors should verify that fish are commercially caught and\nharvested and received from reputable vendors. If fish are being delivered during the\ninspection or if they were received just before inspectors\u2019 arrival, temperatures should\nbe taken, especially if there are finfish such as tuna, mahi-mahi, bluefish, mackerel, and\nsnapper. These fish are subject to scombrotoxin formation if time/temperature abused.\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections",

    "content": "Annex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\nInspectors should verify freshness by conducting an organoleptic inspection of the gills,\neyes, and bodies of the fish.\nInspector should verify that fish, except for certain species of tuna, intended for raw or\nundercooked consumption have been frozen for the required time and temperature\nparameters to destroy parasites by either reviewing freezing records or verifying that a\nletter of guarantee from the purveyor is kept on file. If freezing is conducted on-site,\ninspectors should verify that the freezing records are maintained for at least 90 days\nbeyond the date of sale or service.\nWith regard to the service of game or wild mushrooms, inspectors should ask if these\nproducts are served at any time during the year. If so, inspectors should verify that they\nare from an approved source by reviewing invoices.\nWith regard to juice and milk products, inspectors should verify that fluid milk and milk\nproducts are pasteurized and received at the proper temperature. For packaged juice,\ninspectors should verify that the juice was pasteurized or otherwise treated to achieve a\n5-log reduction of the most resistant microorganism.\nDuring the inspection, inspectors should inquire as to the source of foods that have\nbeen removed from their original containers. If at any time during the inspection there is\nany doubt as to the source of certain products, inspectors should ask for invoices or\nreceipts to demonstrate their source. Certain products, such as flat breads, waffles,\npies, and cakes may require special cooking equipment to prepare. If suitable\nequipment is not on-site to prepare such products and the products are not stored in\noriginal containers, then inspectors should inquire as to the source of these products.\nFood from unapproved, unsafe, or otherwise unverifiable sources should be discarded\nor put on hold or under embargo until appropriate documentation is provided. In\naddition, inspectors should ensure that management and employees are aware of the\nrisk of serving or selling food from unapproved sources. Fish that are intended to be\nconsumed raw or undercooked and for which no freezing certification or equipment is\nfound on-site, can be used in menu items that will be fully cooked. If cooking is not an\noption due to the menu items served, the fish should be discarded.\n(3)\t Assessing Contaminated Equipment and Potential for CrossContamination\n\nThis risk factor involves the proper storage and use of food products and equipment to\nprevent cross-contamination. The cleaning, sanitization, and storage of food-contact\nsurfaces of equipment and utensils in a manner to prevent transmission of foodborne\npathogens or contamination is also included in this risk factor.\nAs inspectors walk through the food establishment, they should examine food storage\nareas for proper storage, separation, segregation, and protection from contamination.\nInspectors should look to see that raw animal foods and ready-to-eat foods are\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\nseparated during receiving, storage, and preparation. For example, cooked shrimp\nshould not be returned to the same container that previously held uncooked product.\nCutting boards should be washed, rinsed, and sanitized between trimming uncooked\nchicken and cooked steak.\nIn addition, raw animal foods should be separated by cooking temperatures such that\nfoods requiring a higher cooking temperature, like chicken, should be stored below or\naway from foods requiring a lower temperature, like pork and beef. If TCS foods are not\nbeing cooled, they should be covered or packaged while in cold storage.\nFollowing the flow of food as it is prepared in the food establishment may alert\ninspectors to opportunities for cross-contamination. When contamination has occurred\nbetween raw and ready-to-eat food, inspectors should assess whether the food can be\nreconditioned. In some cases, depending on the affected food, it may be possible to\nreheat the food to eliminate any hazards. If the food cannot be reconditioned, then the\nfood should be discarded.\nInspectors should verify that exposed food such as chips, bread, and dipping sauces\nare not re-served to the consumer. Consumer self-service operations are addressed in\nthe Code with regard to the types of food offered for consumer self-service, the\nprotection of food on display, and the required monitoring by employees of such\noperations.\nA visual check of the food-contact surfaces of equipment and utensils should be made\nto verify that the utensils are maintained clean and sanitized using the approved manner\nand frequency. Utensils that are observed to have debris, grease, or other visible\ncontamination should be rewashed and resanitized.\nObservations should be made to determine whether practices are in place to eliminate\nthe potential for contamination of utensils, equipment, and single-service items by\nenvironmental contaminants, employees, and consumers. When clean equipment and\nutensils are stored where they are subject to environmental contamination such as near\nhandwashing sinks or prep sinks, inspectors should have the operator rearrange the\nequipment in a manner to prevent cross-contamination. Depending on the\ncircumstances, the operator may need to rewash and resanitize the equipment.\nInspectors should observe handwashing operations. If handwashing sinks and fixtures\nare located where splash may contaminate food contact surfaces or food, then splash\nguards should be installed or food-contact surfaces should be relocated to prevent\ncross-contamination.\nInspectors should pay particular attention to prep sinks, especially those that are\ncurrently in use at the time of the inspection. Built-up grime is a visible sign that the sink\nis not being washed, rinsed, and sanitized appropriately before use. If there are\ndesignated vegetable or meat sinks, inspectors should verify that the placement of sinks\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections",

Questions should be asked to assess how utensils and cookware are\nwashed, rinsed, and sanitized in the food establishment. When assessing the\nwarewashing procedure and equipment, inspectors should pay particular attention to\ncooking and baking equipment that is too large to fit in the dishmachine or sinks. It is a\ngood idea to have the person responsible for dishwashing demonstrate the procedure\nthat is followed in the food establishment by setting up the sinks and watching the\ndishwashing procedure.\n(4) Assessing Cooking Temperatures\nFood cooking temperatures and times should be verified by inspectors during each\ninspection. Every effort should be made to assess the cooking temperatures of a\nvariety of products served in the food establishment.\nTo assess cooking, inspections must occur at times when food is being cooked. It is\nalso important to conduct inspections during busy times, such as lunch and dinner, as\nthere may be a tendency for the operator to rush the cooking of foods during these\ntimes.\nCritical limits for cooking TCS foods in the Food Code include specifications that all\nparts of the food be heated to a certain temperature. For large roasts, temperature\nmeasurement should take into account post-cooking heat rise which allows the\ntemperature to reach equilibrium throughout the food. The critical limit of time at the\nterminal temperature must also be measured during inspections. For example, a roast\nbeef cooked at 54\u00b0C (130\u00b0F) is required to be held at this temperature for 112 minutes\nto ensure destruction of pathogens. Cooking times and temperatures should be noted\non the inspection report.\nThe correct temperature measuring device and technique are essential in accurately\ndetermining the temperatures of TCS foods. The geometric center or thickest part of a\nproduct are the points of measurement of product temperature particularly when\nmeasuring critical limits for cooking.\nInspectors should take internal temperatures of products using a thermocouple or\nthermistor with a probe suitable for the product thickness. A thin diameter probe should\nbe used for temperature measurements of hamburger patties and fish filets.\nAlternately, although less desirable, an inspector may use a suitable, calibrated bimetal\nstem thermometer for checking cooking temperatures of thick foods. Infrared\nthermometers are inappropriate for measuring internal cooking temperatures.\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\nIn order to better assess cooking during all phases of the inspection, inspectors could\nenlist the help of cooperative food employees to notify them of foods that have finished\ncooking. This allows inspectors to continue with the inspection in other areas of the\noperation yet continue to verify that proper cooking temperatures are being met.\nFood establishments should routinely monitor cooking temperatures. Inspections\nshould verify that monitoring is occurring by involving the person in charge in these\nactivities during the regulatory inspection. The presence of required thermometers and\ntheir proper use should be assessed.\nComparisons should be made between inspectors\u2019 calibrated temperature measuring\ndevice and those used by the food establishment. Notation of deviations should be\nmade on the inspection report. Inspectors should ask food establishment personnel to\ndemonstrate proper calibration of their temperature measuring devices.\nIf required cooking temperatures are not met, inspectors should have the operator\ncontinue cooking the food until the proper temperature is reached. Additionally,\ninspectors should explain the public health significance of inadequate cooking to\nmanagement and food employees.\n(5) Assessing Holding Time and Temperatures and Date Marking\nHot and cold holding temperatures, as well as cooling time and temperatures, of TCS\nfoods should be thoroughly checked with a thermocouple, thermistor, or other\nappropriate temperature measuring device during each inspection. This includes the\ntemperature of TCS food during transport, e.g., hot holding carts being used to transport\nfood to patient rooms in a hospital, satellite kitchens, or off-site catering events. As a\nrule, every effort should be made to assess every hot and cold holding unit in the food\nestablishment during a risk-based inspection.\nUse of an infrared thermometer for verifying holding temperatures is not consistent with\nFood Code requirements since verifying only the surface temperature of the food may\nnot alert inspectors to problems that exist under the food\u2019s surface. Such problems\ncould stem from improper cooling, in the case of cold-held foods, or improper reheating,\nin the case of hot-held foods. In addition, inspectors should not stir a food before taking\nits temperature since it is important to know the temperature of the food before it is\nagitated.\nThe geometric center of a product is usually the point of measurement of product\ntemperature particularly when measuring the critical limit for cold holding.\nThe hot holding critical limit may need additional measurements taken at points farthest\nfrom the heat source, e.g., near the product surface for food held on a steam table.\nTemperatures monitored between packages of food, such as cartons of milk or\npackages of meat, may indicate the need for further examination. However, the\ntemperature of a TCS food itself, rather than the temperature between packages, is\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections",

    "content": "However, the\ntemperature of a TCS food itself, rather than the temperature between packages, is\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\nnecessary for regulatory citations. In large holding units and on steam tables, it is\nnecessary to take the temperatures of foods in various locations to ensure that the\nequipment is working properly. If deviations are noted in the product temperatures, it is\nimportant to take extra steps to find out whether the problem is the result of equipment\nfailure or whether a breakdown in a process such as cooling or reheating is the reason\nfor the problem.\nCorrective actions for foods found in violation should be required based on the\njurisdiction\u2019s regulatory food code. If foods are to be discarded, forms such as those\nused for stop sale or embargo may need to be completed and signed by the person in\ncharge in accordance with the jurisdiction\u2019s regulatory food code. In order to properly\nevaluate the degree of time and temperature abuse and the proper disposition of the\naffected food, several issues must be considered. Answers to these questions, in\ncombination with observations made during the inspection, should provide inspectors\nwith enough information to make the appropriate recommendation for on-site correction:\n\u2022\t Are there any written procedures in place for using time alone as a public\nhealth control and, if so, are they being followed properly?\n\u2022\t What are the ingredients of the food and how was it made?\n\u2022\t Is it likely that the food contains Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium\nbotulinum, or Bacillus cereus as hazards?\n\u2022\t Has there been an opportunity for post-cook contamination with raw animal\nfoods or contaminated equipment?\n\u2022\t If there has been an opportunity for post-cook contamination, can the hazards\nof concern be eliminated by reheating?\n\u2022\t Are the food employees practicing good personal hygiene including frequent\nand effective handwashing?\n\u2022\t Was the food reheated or cooked to the proper temperature before being\nallowed out of temperature control?\n\u2022\t What is the current temperature of the food when taken with a probe\nthermometer?\n\u2022\t How long has the food been out of temperature control (ask both the manager\nand food employees)? Are the answers of the food employees and the\nmanager consistent with one another?\n\u2022\t Is it likely that food has cooled to its current temperature after being out of\ntemperature control for the alleged time?\n\u2022\t Will the food be saved as leftovers?\n\u2022\t How long before the food will be served?\n\u2022\t Given what is known about the food, the food\u2019s temperature, the handling of\nthe food, and the alleged time out of temperature, is it reasonably likely that\nthe food already contains hazards that cannot be destroyed by reheating?\nEven if food can be reconditioned by reheating, steps should be taken by the person in\ncharge to ensure compliance in the future. Examples include repairing malfunctioning\nor inoperative equipment or implementing a risk control plan (RCP) to modify\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\npreparation procedures or to institute a procedure for monitoring holding temperatures\nof food.\nIf using time only or time-temperature combinations in lieu of temperature for controlling\nthe growth and toxin-formation of pathogenic bacteria, strict controls must be in place\nand followed. Inspectors should verify that the written procedures are on-site and\nfollowed in accordance with the Food Code.\nDate marking is the mechanism by which active managerial control of time-temperature\ncombinations can prevent the growth of Listeria monocytogenes in TCS, ready-to-eat\nfoods during cold storage. With exceptions, all ready-to-eat, TCS foods prepared onsite and held for more than 24 hours should be date marked to indicate the day or date\nby which the foods need to be served or discarded. Inspectors should ask questions to\nascertain whether the system in place to control for L. monocytogenes meets the intent\nof the Food Code. Food that should be date marked and is not should be discarded.\n(6) Assessing Reheating for Hot Holding\nIn order to assess a food establishment\u2019s control of reheating for hot holding, the time of\nday that the inspection occurs is a key factor. Every effort should be made to schedule\nan inspection during pre-opening preparation. If inspections are conducted during preopening preparation or other preparation periods, inspectors should ask questions\nregarding the history of hot-held foods. Foods in compliance for minimum hot holding\ntemperatures may have in fact been improperly reheated before being placed into hot\nholding units or steam tables.\nIf items are found \u201creheating\u201d on the steam table, further inquiry is needed to assess\nwhether the equipment in question is capable of reheating the food to the proper\ntemperature within the maximum time limit. Corrective action for foods found out of\ncompliance for reheating for hot holding would depend on how long the food had been\nout of temperature and other factors. In most cases, however, the food may be rapidly\nreheated and hot held.\n(7) Assessing Cooling\nImproper cooling remains a major contributor to bacterial foodborne illness. Cooling\ntemperatures and times need to be closely evaluated during every inspection. In order\nto assess whether a food establishment has control over cooling, the time of day that\nthe inspection occurs is critical. Early morning inspections allow an opportunity to verify\nthat leftovers from the night before were cooled properly or cooled using a proper\ncooling method. Alternatively, afternoon inspections may allow an inspector to verify\ncooling of products that may have been prepared that morning.\nBecause many food establishments prepare bulk products only on certain days of the\nweek, it is essential that inspectors become as familiar as possible with each operation\nand schedule their inspections accordingly.\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections",

    "content": "Annex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\nDue to the time parameters involved in cooling, inspectors should always inquire at the\nbeginning of the inspection whether there are any products currently being cooled. This\nallows inspectors an opportunity to take initial temperatures of the products and still\nhave time to re-check temperatures later in the inspection in order to verify that critical\nlimits are being met.\nProblems with cooling can often be discovered through inquiry alone. Even when no\ncooling is taking place, inspectors should ask the food employees and managers\nquestions about the cooling procedures in place.\nWhen examining cold holding units, bulk containers and buckets, tightly packed pans,\nshrouded rolling racks, or closed rolling cabinets should warrant further temperature and\ntime investigation. Bulk containers and buckets should be opened since they are\ncommonly reused for food storage and cooling.\nThe geometric center of a product is often chosen as the point of measurement of\nproduct temperature particularly when measuring the critical limits for cooling. For\nfoods that are being cooled, temperature profiles throughout the product may show\nproper temperatures at outer edges and hot spots at the core of the product. Inspectors\ncan verify cooling by first taking a temperature measurement in the geometric center of\nthe product, then at various points around the perimeter of the product. Warmer\ntemperatures in the center of the product, in combination with cooler temperatures\naround the perimeter, indicate that a product is cooling. Additional questions should be\nasked to ascertain the cooling time parameters of the food in question. Information\ngained from food employees and management, in combination with temperature\nmeasurements taken, should form the basis for assessing compliance of cooling during\nan inspection.\nThe following guidance may be used for determining the appropriate corrective action\nfor improper cooling. Cooked hot food may be reheated to 165 \u00baF for 15 seconds and\nthe cooling process started again using a different cooling method if the food is:\n\u2022 Above 70 \u00baF and two hours or less into the cooling process; and\n\u2022 Above 41 \u00baF and six hours or less into the cooling process.\nCooked hot food should be discarded immediately if the food is:\n\u2022 Above 70 \u00baF and more than two hours into the cooling process; or\n\u2022 Above 41 \u00baF and more than six hours into the cooling process.\nA different, more accelerated, cooling method may be used for prepared ready-to-eat\nfoods if the food is above 41 \u00baF and less than four hours into the cooling process;\nhowever, such foods should be discarded if the food is above 41 \u00baF and more than four\nhours into the cooling process.\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\n(8)\t Assessing Personal Hygiene, Hands As a Vehicle of Contamination, and\nProper Implementation of Employee Health Policies\nSpecial attention should be given to the potential for hands as a vehicle of\ncontamination. An effective management system for prevention of hand contamination\ninvolves three elements:\n\u2022\t Employee health policy\n\u2022\t Proper handwashing\n\u2022\t No bare hand contact with ready-to-eat foods.\nThere are a wide range of communicable diseases and infections that can be\ntransmitted by an infected food employee. Proper management of the risks associated\nwith ill food employees begins with employing healthy people and implementing a policy\nthat excludes or restricts ill employees as specified in Chapter 2 of the Food Code.\nEmployees must be aware of the symptoms, illnesses, or conditions that must be\nreported to the person in charge. In addition, the person in charge must be\nknowledgeable regarding the appropriate action to take should certain symptoms,\nillnesses, or conditions be reported.\nWith regard to the employee health policy, inspectors should ask a series of openended questions to ascertain whether the employee health policy in place complies with\nthe Food Code. The following are example questions that may be asked:\n\u2022\t What kind of policy do you have in place for handling sick employees?\n\u2022\t Is there a written policy? (Note: a written policy is not required in the Food\nCode, but having a written policy may give an indication of the formality of the\npolicy being discussed.)\n\u2022\t Describe how managers and food employees are made knowledgeable about\ntheir duties and responsibilities under the employee health policy.\n\u2022\t Are food employees asked if they are experiencing certain symptoms or\nillnesses upon conditional offer of employment? If so, what symptoms or\nillnesses are food employees asked about? Is there a written record of this\ninquiry?\n\u2022\t What are food employees instructed to do when they are sick?\n\u2022\t What conditions or symptoms are reported?\n\u2022\t What may some indicators be of someone who is working while ill?\n\u2022\t When are employees restricted from working with exposed food or foodcontact surfaces? When are they excluded from working in the food\nestablishment?\n\u2022\t For employees that are sick and cannot come to work, what policy is in place\nfor allowing them to return and for notifying the regulatory authority?\nSpecial attention should be given to the potential for hands as a vehicle of\ncontamination.

    "content": "Ensuring that hands are washed using the proper procedure and at the\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\nappropriate times must be a top priority during every inspection. Data show that viruses\ncan be tenacious even in the presence of good handwashing. Inspectors should\nobserve employee use of utensils and gloves during the preparation and service of\nready-to-eat foods and ingredients, such as salads and sandwiches.\nIf ready-to-eat food is touched with bare hands, inspectors will need to address several\nquestions in order to make the appropriate on-site correction recommendation. The\nanswers to the following questions should provide enough information to determine the\nlikelihood of occurrence of hazards transmitted by bare hands and should be the basis\nfor making a recommendation for on-site correction:\n\u2022\t Does the facility have an employee health policy to identify, restrict, and\nexclude ill employees?\n\u2022\t Did the employees working with the food in question effectively wash their\nhands and are handwashing facilities adequate?\n\u2022\t Is there an approved, alternate procedure to no bare hand contact in place\nand was it followed before the bare hand contact?\n\u2022\t Has there been an opportunity for the employee\u2019s hands to become\ncontaminated?\nInspectors should examine the location of handwashing sinks in relation to where food\nis being prepared. Many jurisdictions use a basic distance measurement as a guideline\nwhen considering the location and number of handwashing sinks required in a food\nestablishment during the plan review process. While this information can be used to\nassist with the review process, it should not be used as the sole basis for determining\nwhether there are an adequate number of handwashing sinks or whether the\nhandwashing sinks are conveniently located.\nSpecial emphasis should be placed on spacing in and around fixed equipment, the\nexpected staffing, and the flow of food throughout a food establishment. For instance, a\nkitchen may be 30 feet in length and 12 feet wide. Although the size of the kitchen may\ndictate only one handwashing sink using a basic distance measurement, if a prep table\nthe length of the line is placed between the line and the handwashing sink, the\nhandwashing sink may not be conveniently located. Likewise, one handwashing sink\nlocated at the end of cook line is useless to employees working at the other end if there\nis limited space for employees to go around one another during busy periods.\n(9)\t Assessing Compliance with Approved Procedures\nWhen conducting certain specialized processes, variances and HACCP plans are\nrequired by the Code. This is because such processes carry a considerable risk if not\nconducted under strict controls. For food establishments conducting specialized\nprocesses, each inspection should involve a review of the written variance, if applicable,\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\nand the implementation of the HACCP plan to ensure that food safety hazards are being\nconsistently controlled.\n(10) Assessing Special Requirements Related to Highly Susceptible\nPopulations (HSP)\nFood establishments that serve highly susceptible populations (HSP) must adhere to\nadditional requirements as specified under Part 3-8 of the Code. Every effort should be\nmade to inspect such facilities during preparation, service, or other applicable times to\nassess these additional requirements as well as those in other sections of the Food\nCode.\nBecause those persons who are very young, elderly, or who live in a facility that\nprovides custodial care are extremely vulnerable to foodborne illness because of age or\nhealth status, it is important that risk factors be controlled on-site in a timely manner.\nInspections of HSP facilities should be conducted by inspectors knowledgeable in the\ncontrol of foodborne illness risk factors who take extra care to assure that the most\nvulnerable segment of the population are not at risk.\n(11) Assessing Labeling, Storage, and Use of Poisonous and Toxic\n\nChemicals\n\nDuring each inspection, the proper labeling, storage, and use of poisonous and toxic\nchemicals should be verified. Containers of poisonous or toxic materials and personal\ncare items shall bear a legible manufacturer's label. Working containers used for\nstoring poisonous or toxic materials such as cleaners and sanitizers taken from bulk\nsupplies should be clearly and individually identified with the common name of the\nmaterial. Only chemicals that are necessary to the operation and maintenance of a\nfood establishment, such as for the cleaning and sanitizing of equipment and utensils\nand the control of insects and rodents, should be in the food establishment. Medicines\nnecessary for the health of employees may be allowed in a food establishment, but they\nshould be labeled and stored to prevent contamination of food and food-contact\nsurfaces.\nInspectors should verify that solutions containing poisonous and toxic chemicals, like\nmop water, are discarded in an appropriate service sink to prevent contamination of\nfood and food-contact surfaces. In addition, inspectors should check delivery trucks to\nverify that food is protected from chemical contamination during shipment. Any food\nthat has been cross-contaminated with poisonous or toxic chemicals should be\ndiscarded or rejected immediately.\n(12) Assessing Compliance with Consumer Advisory\nInspectors should ascertain whether animal foods such as beef, eggs, fish, lamb, milk,\npork, poultry, or shellfish are served or sold raw, undercooked, or without otherwise\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\nbeing processed to eliminate pathogens, either in ready-to-eat form or as an ingredient\nin another ready-to-eat food. Inspectors should review the menu or food list to verify\nthat a consumer advisory with a disclosure and reminder is present as specified under\n\u00a7 3-603.11 of the Food Code.\nIn addition to reviewing the menu or food list, inspectors should ask whether raw or\nundercooked foods are served or sold routinely or seasonally. It is useful to know foods\nthat are often served in this manner such as oysters-on-the half shell, hollandaise\nsauce, b\u00e9arnaise sauce, eggnog, salad dressings, hamburgers to order, or sunny-sideup eggs.\nH.\t Evaluating Basic Sanitation and Facilities (Good Retail Practices)\nAn important part of a risk-based, routine inspection is to review how the food\nestablishment actively monitors the active managerial control of foodborne illness risk\nfactors and interventions; however, overall sanitation should not be overlooked.\nSystems to control basic operational and sanitation conditions within a food\nestablishment, referred to as Good Retail Practices (GRPs), are the foundation of a\nsuccessful food safety management system. GRPs found to be out-of-compliance may\ngive rise to conditions that may lead to foodborne illness, e.g., sewage backing up in the\nkitchen. Just as monitoring is required by the food establishment to ensure that\nfoodborne illness risk factors are controlled and interventions are in place, monitoring of\nbasic sanitation conditions in the food establishment allows the operator an excellent\nopportunity to detect weaknesses and initiate actions for improvement. Basic\noperational and sanitation programs must be in place to:\n\u2022\t Protect products from contamination by biological, chemical, and physical\nfood safety hazards\n\u2022\t Control bacterial growth that can result from temperature abuse during\nstorage\n\u2022\t Maintain equipment, especially equipment used to maintain product\ntemperatures.\nExamples of concerns addressed by the basic operation and sanitation programs\nmentioned above include the following:\n\u2022\t Pest control\n\u2022\t Food protection (CORE ITEM)\n\u2022\t Equipment maintenance\n\u2022\t Water\n\u2022\t Plumbing\n\u2022\t Toilet facilities\n\u2022\t Sewage\n\u2022\t Garbage and refuse disposal\n\u2022\t Physical facilities.\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections",

Developing an Effective Compliance and Enforcement Protocol\nCompliance and enforcement are essential elements of a regulatory program and\nencompass all voluntary and regulatory enforcement actions taken to achieve\ncompliance with regulations. Standards 3 and 6 of the Program Standards explain the\nneed of regulatory jurisdictions to establish a compliance and enforcement protocol that\nresults in credible follow-up for each violation noted during an inspection, especially\nviolations related to foodborne illness risk factors and Food Code interventions. Lack of\nfollow-up on the part of the regulatory agency signals to the operator that the priority\nitem and priority foundation item violations noted were not important.\nThe resolution of out-of-compliance foodborne illness risk factors and Food Code\ninterventions must be documented in each food establishment record. The desired\noutcome of Standard 6 is an effective compliance and enforcement program that is\nimplemented consistently to achieve compliance with regulatory requirements.\nCompliance and enforcement options may vary depending on state and local law. It is\nessential that regulatory jurisdictions develop a written compliance and enforcement\nprotocol that details the order in which both voluntary corrections may be taken on the\npart of the operator and involuntary enforcement actions are to be taken on the part of\nthe regulatory authority. Involuntary enforcement actions include, but are not limited to,\nsuch activities as warning letters, re-inspections, citations, administrative fines, permit\nsuspensions, and hearings.\nFood establishment with a history of noncompliance at a level predetermined by the\njurisdiction or with the number of foodborne illness risk factors and interventions violated\nwarranting a regulatory action, signals the need either a strong regulatory response or\nan alternate approach to compliance to protect public health, e.g., active managerial\ncontrol, behavioral change.\nVoluntary corrections taken on the part of the operator include, but are not limited to,\nsuch activities as on-site corrections at the time of inspection, voluntary destruction, risk\ncontrol plans, and remedial training. Obtaining voluntary corrections by the operator\ncan be very effective in achieving long-term compliance. Voluntary corrections by the\noperator are referred to in FDA\u2019s Regulator\u2019s Manual as \u201cintervention strategies.\u201d\nIntervention strategies can be divided into two groups:\n\u2022 Those designed to achieve immediate on-site correction\n\u2022 Those designed to achieve long-term compliance.\nSuccessful intervention strategies for out-of-control foodborne illness risk factors can be\ntailored to each operation\u2019s resources and needs. This will require inspectors to work\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\nwith the operator to identify weaknesses in the existing food safety management system\nand consulting with the operator to strengthen any weak areas noted.\nB.\t On-site Correction\nOn-site corrections are intended to achieve immediate corrective action of out-of-control\nfoodborne illness risk factors posing an immediate, serious danger to the consumer\nduring the inspection. Usually these violations are \"operational\" rather than structural\nand can be addressed by management at the time of the inspection.\nIt is essential to consumer protection and to regulatory credibility for on-site\ncorrection to be obtained for any out-of-control foodborne illness risk factors\nbefore completing the inspection and leaving the food establishment. Obtaining\non-site correction conveys the seriousness of the violation to management. Failure to\nrequire on-site correction when an out-of-control risk factor has been identified implies\nthat the risk factor has little importance to food safety.\nWhen recommending on-site correction, effective communication regarding out-ofcontrol foodborne illness risk factors is essential and can be accomplished best by:\n\u2022\t Discussing food safety concerns in words that can be easily understood by\nthe person in charge and employees\n\u2022\t Conveying the seriousness of the out-of-control foodborne illness risk factors\nin terms of increased risk of illness or injury.\nDuring the discussion of inspection findings with the person in charge, inspectors should\nkeep the discussion focused on correction of violations that present an immediate\ndanger to the consumer. Discussion of less serious code violations should be deferred\nuntil out-of-control foodborne illness risk factors are discussed and on-site correction is\nobtained.\nIn most cases, selecting the most appropriate on-site correction when out-of-control\nfoodborne illness risk factors are observed will be straightforward; however, in instances\nsuch as improper cooling, the appropriate corrective action may be more complicated.\nSince determining on-site correction depends on a number of factors, an inspector may\nneed to conduct a hazard analysis of the food in order to determine the appropriate\ncourse of action to take.\nC.\t Intervention Strategies for Achieving Long-term Compliance\nWhile on-site correction of out-of-control foodborne illness risk factors is essential to\nconsumer protection, achieving long-term compliance and behavior change is equally\nimportant. Overcoming several misconceptions about long-term compliance will help in\nachieving a desirable change of behavior. For example, in jurisdictions using a 44-item\ninspection report in which only observed violations are marked, it is often taken for\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections",

    "content": "For example, in jurisdictions using a 44-item\ninspection report in which only observed violations are marked, it is often taken for\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\ngranted that if there are no violations marked, the foodborne illness risk factors are\nbeing controlled. This is not necessarily true since the observation of code violations is\nsubject to many variables such as the time of day, day of the week, or duration of the\ninspection. An inspection system that records only observed violations rather than the\nactual status of all foodborne illness risk factors, such as whether the risk factor was in\ncompliance, not observed, or not applicable to the operation, may be unable to detect\nsome foodborne illness risk factors that are continually or cyclically out of control.\nAnother misconception is that training alone will result in foodborne illness risk factors\nbeing controlled. While training may help, there is no guarantee that knowledge\nacquired will equate to knowledge applied in the workplace. In order for knowledge to\ntranslate into changed behavior, it must be reinforced and the behavior must be\nrepeated for a period of time sufficient for the behavior to become an ingrained pattern.\nAnother assumption is that regulatory enforcement actions such as citations or\nadministrative hearings or on-site corrections alone will automatically result in future\nmanagement control. Unfortunately, there is no assurance that any of these actions will\nresult in the long-term control of foodborne illness risk factors.\nLong-term compliance may best be achieved through voluntary actions by the operator.\nIf an operator supports the concept that a food safety management system is needed,\nthere is a better chance that long-term compliance will be achieved. The following are\nways operators can better ensure long-term active managerial control of foodborne\nillness risk factors.\n(1)\t Change Equipment and Layout\nCritical limits are difficult to achieve when equipment does not work properly. Proper\ncalibration of equipment is vital to achieving food safety. When calibration is\nunsuccessful or is not feasible, equipment should be replaced. In addition to equipment\nmalfunctioning, poor equipment layout can present opportunities for cross\ncontamination and must be considered. For example:\n\u2022\t Hamburgers with uniform thickness and weight are not all reaching a safe\ncooking temperature in a given time. Upon examination, it is determined that\nthe grill is distributing heat unevenly. A new element is installed to correct the\nproblem.\n\u2022\t Splash from a nearby handwashing sink is seen on a prep table. A splash\nguard is installed to prevent cross contamination from the handwashing sink\nto the prep table.\n(2)\t Establish Buyer Specifications\nWritten specifications for the goods and services purchased by a food establishment\nprevent many problems. For example:\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\n\u2022\t Fish posing a parasite hazard and intended for raw consumption have not\nbeen frozen for the specified time and temperature and no freezing\nequipment is on-site at the food establishment. Buyer specifications are\nestablished to place the responsibility for freezing the fish on the supplier.\n\u2022\t Lobster tails, hamburgers, or other products cooked with a set time parameter\non a conveyor are not reaching the proper temperature in the specified time\nbecause they are larger than the size for which the conveyor is calibrated.\nBuyer specifications are established to restrict the size of products received\nfrom the supplier.\n(3)\t Develop and Implement Recipe/Process Instructions\nSimple control measures integrated into recipes and processes can improve\nmanagement control over foodborne illness risk factors. For example:\n\u2022\t Process instructions that specify using color-coded cutting boards for\nseparating raw animal foods from ready-to-eat products are developed to\ncontrol the potential for cross contamination.\n\u2022\t Pasteurized eggs are substituted in recipes that call for raw or undercooked\neggs to reduce the risk of foodborne illness.\n\u2022\t Commercially precooked chicken is used in recipes calling for cooked chicken\nsuch as chicken salad to reduce the risk of contaminating food-contact\nsurfaces and ready-to-eat food with raw chicken.\n\u2022\t Pasta is chilled in an ice bath immediately after cooking and before\napportioning into single servings. This is specified in the procedures for\ncooking spaghetti.\n(4)\t Establish First-In-First-Out (FIFO) Procedures\nProduct rotation is important for both quality and safety reasons. \u201cFirst-In-First-Out\u201d\n(FIFO) means that the first batch of product prepared and placed in storage should be\nthe first one sold or used. Date marking foods as required by the Food Code facilitates\nthe use of a FIFO procedure in refrigerated, ready-to-eat, TCS foods. The FIFO\nconcept limits the potential for pathogen growth, encourages product rotation, and\ndocuments compliance with time/temperature requirements.\n(5)\t Develop and Implement Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)\nFollowing standardized, written procedures for performing various tasks ensures that\nquality, efficiency, and safety criteria are met each time the task is performed. Although\nevery operation is unique, the following list contains some common management areas\nthat can be controlled with SOPs:\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\n\u2022\t Personnel (disease control, cleanliness, training)\n\u2022\t Facility maintenance\n\u2022\t Sanitary conditions (general cleaning schedule, chemical storage, pest\ncontrol, sanitization of food-contact surfaces)\n\u2022\t Sanitary facilities (approved water supply and testing, if applicable, scheduled\nin-house inspection of plumbing, sewage disposal, handwashing and toilet\nfacilities, trash removal)\n\u2022\t Equipment and utensil maintenance.\nSOPs can also be developed to detail procedures for controlling foodborne illness risk\nfactors:\n\u2022\t Procedures are implemented for measuring temperatures at a given\nfrequency and for taking appropriate corrective actions to prevent hazards\nassociated inadequate cooking.\n\u2022\t Adequate handwashing is achieved by following written procedures that\ndictate frequency, proper technique, and monitoring.\n(6)\t Develop and Implement Risk Control Plans (RCPs)\nAn RCP is a concisely written management plan developed by the retail or food service\noperator with input from inspectors that describes a management system for controlling\nspecific out-of-control foodborne illness risk factors. An RCP is intended to be a\nvoluntary strategy that inspectors and the person in charge jointly develop to promote\nlong-term compliance for specific out-of-control foodborne illness risk factors. For\nexample, if food is improperly cooled in the establishment, a system of monitoring and\nrecord keeping outlined in an RCP can ensure that new procedures are established to\nadequately cool the food in the future. An RCP should require that the basic control\nsystems in the plan be implemented for a designated period of time (e.g., 60 \u2013 90 days)\nand allow inspector oversight. The longer the plan is implemented, the more likely it is\nthat the new controls will become \"habits\" that continue to be used in the food\nestablishment after inspector oversight ends.\nAn RCP should stress simple control measures that can be integrated into the daily\nroutine. It should be brief, no more than one page for each risk factor, and address the\nfollowing points in very specific terms:\n\u2022\t What is the risk factor to be controlled?\n\u2022\t How is the risk factor controlled?\n\u2022\t Who is responsible for the control?\n\u2022\t What monitoring and record keeping is required?\n\u2022\t Who is responsible for monitoring and completing records?\n\u2022\t What corrective actions should be taken when deviations are noted?\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections",

Since the RCP is\ntailored to meet the needs of the food establishment, the operator takes complete\nownership of the plan and is ultimately responsible for its development and\nimplementation. The role of inspectors are to consult with the operator by suggesting\nways that the risk factor(s) might be controlled.\nBy creating an RCP, the operator realizes that a problem exists in the established food\nsafety management system and commits to a specific correction plan rather than merely\nacknowledging a single violation. Follow up by telephone or in person indicates to the\noperator that inspectors are interested in seeing the plan succeed. This also gives\ninspectors an opportunity to answer any questions and offer feedback to the operator to\nmake the RCP more useful. An example of an RCP, along with a blank template that\ncan be used by regulatory jurisdictions, is found in FDA\u2019s Regulator\u2019s Manual:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/HACCP/ucm2006812.htm\n(7)\t Develop and Implement Comprehensive Voluntary Food Safety\n\nManagement Systems based on HACCP Principles\n\nThe Food Code only requires HACCP plans for a few specialized processes; however,\nthe development of voluntary HACCP plans is always encouraged. FDA Operator\u2019s\nManual, \"Managing Food Safety: A Manual for the Voluntary Use of HACCP Principles\nfor Operators of Food Service and Retail Establishments\" is written to aid food\nestablishment managers in the development of food safety management systems based\non HACCP principles. A retail or food service operator, in consultation with an\nappropriate regulatory authority or other food safety professional, can use this\ndocument to establish an effective food safety management system to control for all\nfoodborne illness risk factors. This document is available from FDA through the\nfollowing website:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/HACCP/ucm2006811.htm\n6.\t INSPECTION FORM AND SCORING\nA.\t The Inspection Form\nThe inspection form is the official document utilized by a regulatory agency for\ndocumentation of compliance of the food establishment with regulatory requirements.\nThe goal of the inspection form is to clearly, concisely, and fairly present the compliance\nstatus of the food establishment and to convey compliance information to the permit\nholder or person in charge at the conclusion of the inspection.\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\nThe inspection report should be kept in the food establishment's files for subsequent\ncompliance actions and review before the next inspection. Individual inspection reports\nare to be made available for public review in accordance with Freedom of Information\ncriteria.\nAnnex 7 of the Food Code provides an inspection form that may be completed for\nroutine, follow-up, and compliance inspections. This inspection form meets\nrequirements established in Standards 3 and 6 of the Program Standards.\nB. Debiting Methodology\nIf a violation exists during an inspection, it should always be marked on the inspection\nreport, even if corrected on site. Violations existing at the time of the inspection\nprobably would have persisted if it were not for the inspection. Slight violations, such as\none dirty utensil among hundreds of clean utensils, does not indicate that the food\nestablishment is significantly deviating from the Code requirements; therefore,\ndiscretion in marking is required.\nIt is very important to investigate the root causes of violations and mark them\nappropriately. Without taking this extra step, inspectors will merely point out violations\nand will not identify weaknesses in the management system in place. If long-term\ncontrol of the behaviors or practices leading to the violations is expected, inspectors\nmust identify the causes.\nC. Scoring\nRegulatory agencies may use scoring methods to rate food establishments. Depending\non the system used, establishment scoring may provide an indication of how well a food\nestablishment is complying with the food safety rules of the regulatory agency.\nSome agencies use a system of compliance tools as provided in Chapter 8 and Annex 1\nof the Food Code to protect public health. The inspection score may serve as the basis\nfor triggering follow-up inspections or other forms of regulatory sanctions when they fall\ntoo far from the accepted levels. In addition, scoring may provide a mechanism for\nconsumers to make informed choices regarding where they want to eat.\nUse of scoring systems also has negative consequences. For example, it is possible for\na food establishment to receive a high numerical or letter score while exhibiting some\nvery serious deficiencies. In recognition of this drawback, some jurisdictions forego\nscoring systems in favor of demerits or debit systems without assigning a final score.\nThis focuses attention on the items needing correction. Compliance and enforcement\ndecisions can still be based on the increasing levels of identified deficiencies. Whatever\nmethod or system of establishment rating is used, policies regarding follow-up and\nenforcement actions should be established in writing, linked to the rating system, and\nadministered consistently.\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\n7. CLOSING CONFERENCE\nThe closing conference should include a detailed discussion of the food establishment's\nplans for correcting violations found during the inspection. The evidence collected or\nobserved during the inspection and the alternatives available for compliance should be\nemphasized. On-site corrections made during the inspection should be acknowledged\non the inspection report and in the closing conference.\nThe compliance plan should address changes in procedures that will prevent the\nrecurrence of noted violations. The food establishment's compliance plans should be\nformally documented on the inspection report form. Follow-up letters may be necessary\nto elicit fulfillment of these agreements. It is important to stress to the operator that\nlong-term correction of violations related to foodborne illness risk factors and Food\nCode interventions is far more important than corrections of core items.\n\n8. SUMMARY\nAlthough a retail and food service operator has the responsibility for establishing a food\nsafety management system for controlling foodborne illness risk factors, inspectors\nhave a vital, multi-faceted role in consumer protection. It is essential that inspectors are\nprovided with the proper training, equipment, time, and resources to adequately perform\ntheir jobs.\nThe primary role of inspectors is to ensure that the operator has effective control of\nfoodborne illness risk factors. Once inspectors have established a dialogue with the\nperson in charge and employees, conducted a menu/food list review, and established a\ndialogue with the person in charge, inspectors will have enough information to mentally\nplace menu items into one of the three process flows. The inspection can then focus on\nassessing the operator\u2019s active managerial control of foodborne illness risk factors\nassociated with each process.\nOnce out-of-control foodborne illness risk factors are identified, the role of inspectors\nshifts to assisting the operator with strengthening the existing food safety management\nsystem through intervention strategies designed to achieve immediate and long-term\ncompliance. With inspector\u2019s assistance, a retail and food service operator can achieve\nlong-term behavioral change resulting in a reduction in risk factor occurrence and an\nincrease in public health protection.\nAnnex 5 \u2013 Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n\nAnnex\n6 Food Processing\nCriteria",

INTRODUCTION\nFrom its inception, the retail segment of the food industry has prepared foods in\nconsumer-sized portions, using commercially available equipment for cutting, grinding,\nslicing, cooking, and refrigeration, and applying herbs and spices readily available to\nconsumers at their local grocery.\nOver the past score of years, retail segment operators have expanded into food\nmanufacturing/processing-type operations, often using sophisticated new technologies\nand equipment that are sometimes microprocessor-controlled. Many now desire to\nalter the atmospheres within food packages, or apply federally regulated chemical food\nadditives as a method of food preservation. Food processing operations now being\nconducted or proposed include cook-chill; vacuum packaging; sous vide; smoking and\ncuring; brewing, processing, and bottling alcoholic beverages, carbonated beverages,\nor drinking water; and custom processing of animals.\nThe Food Code specifies that a HACCP plan acceptable to the regulatory authority be\nthe basis for approving food manufacturing/processing operations at retail. The\nHACCP plans are to be provided and accepted in two ways as follows.\n(A) Reduced Oxygen Packaging\nSection 3-502.12 of the Food Code provides the criteria that are to be met in the\nHACCP plans of those operators who are conducting reduced oxygen packaging (ROP)\noperations. Unless prior approval of the HACCP plan is required by the regulatory\nauthority, the HACCP plan covering this operation along with the related records\ndocumenting monitoring and corrective actions need only be available and acceptable\nto the regulatory authority at the time of inspection.\nAnnex 6 \u2013 Food Processing Criteria\n\n(B) Other Food Manufacturing/Processing Operations\nExcept for ROP as discussed in (A) above, the Food Code specifies under \u00a7\u00a7 3-502.11,\n8-103.10, 8-103.11, and 8-201.13 that the food establishment operator must obtain a\nvariance from the regulatory authority for all food manufacturing/processing operations\nbased on the prior approval of a HACCP plan.\nThe purpose of this Annex is to provide processing criteria for different types of food\nmanufacturing/processing operations for use by those preparing and reviewing HACCP\nplans and proposals. Criteria for additional processes will be provided as they are\ndeveloped, reviewed, and accepted.\n\n2. REDUCED OXYGEN PACKAGING\n(A) Introduction\nROP which provides an environment that contains little or no oxygen, offers unique\nadvantages and opportunities for the food industry but also raises many microbiological\nconcerns. Products packaged using ROP may be produced safely if proper controls\nare in effect. Producing and distributing these products with a HACCP approach offer\nan effective, rational, and systematic method for the assurance of food safety. Nontime/temperature control for safety food, defined in Chapter 1, does not require a\nvariance or HACCP Plan for ROP. This Annex will provide guidelines for effective food\nsafety controls for retail food establishments covering the receipt, processing,\npackaging, holding, displaying, and labeling of food in reduced oxygen packages.\n(B) Definitions\nThe term ROP can be used to describe any packaging procedure that results in a\nreduced oxygen level in a sealed package. The term is often used because it is an\ninclusive term and can include packaging options such as:\n(1) Cook-chill packaging, in which cooked food is hot filled into impermeable\nbags which have the air expelled and are then sealed or crimped closed. The\nbagged food is rapidly chilled and refrigerated at temperatures that inhibit the\ngrowth of psychrotrophic pathogens.\n(2) Controlled Atmosphere Packaging (CAP) in which the atmosphere of a\npackage of food is modified so that until the package is opened, its composition\nis different from air, and continuous control of that atmosphere is maintained,\nsuch as by using oxygen scavengers or a combination of total replacement of\noxygen, nonrespiring food, and impermeable packaging material.\n(3) Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) in which the atmosphere of a\npackage of food is modified so that its composition is different from air but the\nAnnex 6 \u2013 Food Processing Criteria\n\natmosphere may change over time due to the permeability of the packaging\nmaterial or the respiration of the food. Modified atmosphere packaging includes\nreduction in the proportion of oxygen, total replacement of oxygen, or in increase\nin the proportion of other gases such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen.\n(4) Sous Vide , in which raw or partially cooked food is placed in a hermetically\nsealed, impermeable bag, cooked in the bag, rapidly chilled, and refrigerated at\ntemperatures that inhibit the growth of psychrotrophic pathogens.\n(5) Vacuum Packaging in which air is removed from the package of food and\nthe package is hermetically sealed so that a vacuum remains inside the\npackage.\n(C) Benefits of ROP\nROP can create a significantly anaerobic environment that prevents the growth of\naerobic spoilage organisms, which generally are Gram-negative bacteria such as\npseudomonads or aerobic yeast and molds. These organisms are responsible for offodors, slime, and texture changes, which are signs of spoilage.\nROP can be used to prevent degradation or oxidative processes in food products.\nReducing the oxygen in and around a food retards the amount of oxidative rancidity in\nfats and oils. ROP also prevents color deterioration in raw meats caused by oxygen.\nAn additional effect of sealing food in ROP is the reduction of product shrinkage by\npreventing water loss.\nThese benefits of ROP allow an extended shelf life for vacuum packaged (VP),\nmodified atmosphere packaged (MAP) and controlled atmosphere packaged (CAP)\nfoods displayed for retail sale. Cook chill (CC) and sous vide (SV) processed food\ncannot be sold directly to consumers or other businesses but the extended shelf life\nand quality benefits internal service and use of the products. Providing an extended\nshelf life for ready-to-eat convenience foods and advertising foods as \"Fresh \u2013 Never\nFrozen\" are examples of economic and quality advantages.\nAnnex 6 \u2013 Food Processing Criteria",

    "content": "Annex 6 \u2013 Food Processing Criteria\n\n(D) Safety Concerns\nUse of ROP with some foods can markedly increase safety concerns. Unless\ntime/temperature control for safety foods are protected inherently, simply placing them\nin ROP without regard to microbial growth will increase the risk of foodborne illnesses.\nROP processors and regulators must assure that during distribution of foods or while\nfoods are held by retailers or consumers, refrigerated temperatures must be\nconsistently maintained. In fact, a serious concern is that the increased use of vacuum\npackaging at retail supermarket deli-type operations may be followed by temperature\nabuse in the establishment or by the consumer. Consequently, at least one barrier or\nmultiple hurdles resulting in a barrier needs to be incorporated into the production\nprocess for products packaged using ROP. The incorporation of several sub-inhibitory\nbarriers, none of which could individually inhibit microbial growth but which in\ncombination provide a full barrier to growth (the hurdle concept), is necessary to ensure\nfood safety.\nSome products in ROP contain no preservatives and frequently do not possess any\nintrinsic inhibitory barriers (such as, pH, aw, or salt concentrations) that either alone or\nin combination will inhibit microbial growth. Thus, product safety is not provided by\nnatural or formulated characteristics.\nA reduced oxygen atmosphere provides the potential for growth of several important\nfoodborne pathogens. Some of these pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes\nare psychrotrophic and grow slowly at temperatures near the freezing point of foods.\nAdditionally, the inhibition of the spoilage bacteria is significant because without these\ncompeting organisms, tell-tale signs signaling that the product is no longer fit for\nconsumption will not occur.\nThe use of one form of ROP, vacuum packaging, is not new. Many food products have\na long and safe history of being vacuum packaged in ROP. However, the early use of\nvacuum packaging for smoked fish had disastrous results, causing a long-standing\nmoratorium on certain uses of this technology at the retail level.\n(1) Refrigerated Holding Requirements for Foods in ROP\nSafe use of ROP technology demands that adequate refrigeration be maintained during\nthe entire shelf-life of time/temperature control for safety foods to ensure product\nsafety.\nBacteria, with the exception of those that can form spores, are eliminated by\npasteurization. However, pathogens may survive in the final product if pasteurization is\ninadequate, poor quality raw materials or poor handling practices are used, or postprocessing contamination occurs. Even if foods that are in ROP receive adequate\nthermal processing, a particular concern is present at retail when employees open\nmanufactured products and repackage them. This operation presents the potential for\npost-processing contamination by pathogens.\nAnnex 6 \u2013 Food Processing Criteria\n\nIf products in ROP are subjected to mild temperature abuse, i.e., 5o\n-12o\nC (41o\n-53o\nF), at\nany stage during storage or distribution, foodborne pathogens, including Bacillus\ncereus, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus,\ncan grow slowly. Marginal refrigeration that does not facilitate growth may still allow\nSalmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., and Brucella spp. to survive for long periods of\ntime.\nPublished surveys indicate that refrigeration practices at retail need improvement.\nSome refrigerated products offered in convenience stores were found at or above 7.2o\nC\n(45o\nF) 50% of the time; in several cases temperatures as high as 10o\nC (50o\nF) were\nobserved. Delicatessen display cases have been shown to demonstrate poor\ntemperature control. Foods have been observed above 10o\nC (50o\nF) and above 12.8o\nC\n(55o\nF) in several instances. Supermarket fresh meat cases appear to have a relatively\ngood record of temperature control. However, even these foods can occasionally be\nfound above 10o\nC (50o\nF).\nTemperature abuse is common throughout distribution and retail markets. Strict\nadherence to temperature control and shelf-life must be observed and documented by\nthe establishment using ROP. Buyer specifications for refrigerated distribution systems\nas well as internal time/temperature controls should be implemented by the\nestablishment. Information on temperature control should also be provided to the\nconsumer. Currently these controls are not extensively used.\n(2)\t Control of Clostridium botulinum and Listeria monocytogenes in\nReduced Oxygen Packaged Foods\nThere has been an increased interest in ROP at retail using conventional refrigeration\nunits for holding. Refrigerated foods packaged at retail may be chilled either after they\nare physically prepared and repackaged, or packaged after a cooking step. In either\ncase Clostridium botulinum and Listeria monocytogenes are the pathogens of\nconcern for ROP products.\nClostridium botulinum is the causative agent of botulism, a severe food poisoning\ncharacterized by double vision, paralysis, and occasionally death. The organism is an\nanaerobic spore-forming bacteria that produces a potent neurotoxin. The spores are\nubiquitous in nature, relatively heat-resistant, and can survive most minimal heat\ntreatments that destroy vegetative cells. Certain strains of C. botulinum (type E and\nnon-proteolytic types B and F), which have been primarily associated with fish, are\npsychrotrophic and can grow and produce toxin at temperatures as low as 3.3o\nC (38o\nF).\nOther strains of C. botulinum (type A and proteolytic types B and F) can grow and\nproduce toxin at temperatures slightly above 10o\nC (50o\nF). If present, C. botulinum\ncould potentially grow and render a food PACKAGED and held in ROP toxigenic because\nmost other competing organisms are inhibited by ROP. Therefore, the food could be\ntoxic yet appear organoleptically acceptable.\nThis is particularly true of psychrotrophic strains of C. botulinum that do not produce\ntell-tale proteolytic enzymes which result in a distinct bad odor. Because botulism is\nAnnex 6 \u2013 Food Processing Criteria",

    "content": "Because botulism is\nAnnex 6 \u2013 Food Processing Criteria\n\npotentially deadly, foods held in anaerobic conditions merit regulatory concern and\nvigilance.\nThe potential for Clostridium botulinum toxin to develop also exists when ROP is\nused after heat treatments such as pasteurization, or sous vide processing of foods\nwhich will not destroy the spores of C. botulinum. Mild heat treatments (heat shocks)\nin combination with ROP may actually select for C. botulinum by killing off competitors.\nIf the applied heat treatment does not produce commercial sterility, the food requires\nrefrigeration below 3.3o\nC (38o\nF) to prevent spore germination and toxin formation and\nensure product safety. For this reason, sous vide products are frequently frozen and\nheld in frozen storage until use.\nThere is a further microbial concern with ROP at retail. Processed products such as\nmeats and cheeses which have undergone an adequate cooking step to kill\nL. monocytogenes can be re-contaminated when opened, sliced, and repackaged at\nretail. Thus, a simple packaging or repackaging operation can present an opportunity\nfor recontamination with pathogens if strict sanitary safeguards are not in place. Hard\nand semi-soft cheeses that meet the Standards of Identity for those cheeses in 21 CFR\n133.150 Hard cheeses, 21 CFR 133.169 Pasteurized process cheese and 21 CFR\n133.187 Semi-soft cheeses may be packaged using ROP without a variance. Refer to\nAnnex 3 Public Health Reasons, Sections 3-501.17 and 3-501.18 for a partial list of\nhard and semi-soft cheeses.\nProcessors of products using ROP should build in extra safeguards if they plan to rely\non refrigeration as the sole barrier that ensures product safety. This approach requires\nvery rigorous temperature controls of products and refrigeration equipment. If extended\nshelf life is sought, a temperature of 3.3o\nC (38o\nF) or lower must be maintained at all\ntimes to prevent outgrowth of C. botulinum and the subsequent production of toxin.\nListeria monocytogenes can grow at even lower temperatures; consequently,\nappropriate use-by dates must be established. Growth barriers are provided by hurdles\nsuch as low pH, aw, or short shelf life, and constant monitoring of the product\ntemperature. Any one hurdle, or a combination of several, may be used with\nrefrigeration to control pathogenic outgrowth.\n(3) Design of Heat Processes for Foods in Reduced Oxygen Packages\nHeat processes for sous vide or cook-chill operations must be designed so that, at a\nminimum, all vegetative pathogens are destroyed by a pasteurization process and\ntemperature control is verified. When temperature is the only barrier and no other\nintrinsic or extrinsic factors add protection against the growth of foodborne pathogens\nand formation of toxin, the product may not be sold to other business entities or to the\nconsumer in the ROP package because of the inability to verify temperature control.\nThe National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF),\nchartered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health\nand Human Services (DHHS), commented on the microbial safety of refrigerated foods\nAnnex 6 \u2013 Food Processing Criteria\n\nFinally, if foods are held long enough, even under proper refrigeration, extended shelf\nlife may be a problem. A study on fresh vegetables inoculated with\nL. monocytogenes, conducted to determine the effect of MAP on shelf life, found that\nMAP lengthened the time that all vegetables were considered acceptable, but that\npopulations of L. monocytogenes increased during that extended storage.\ncontaining cooked, uncured meat or poultry products that are packaged for extended\nrefrigerated shelf life and are ready-to-eat or prepared with little or no additional heat\ntreatment. NACMCF recommended guidelines for evaluating the ability of thermal\nprocesses to inactivate L. monocytogenes in extended shelf life refrigerated foods.\nSpecifically, it recommended a proposed requirement for demonstrating that an ROP\nprocess provides a heat treatment sufficient to achieve a 4 decimal log reduction (4D)\nof L. monocytogenes.\nOther scientific reports recommend more extensive thermal processing. Thermal\nprocesses for sous vide practiced in Europe are designed to achieve a 12-13 log\nreduction (12-13D) of the target organism Streptococcus faecalis. It is reasoned that\nthermal inactivation of this organism would ensure destruction of all other vegetative\npathogens.\nFood manufacturers with adequate in-house research and development programs may\nhave the ability to design their own thermal processes. However, small retailers and\nsupermarkets may not be able to perform the microbiological challenge studies\nnecessary to provide the same level of food safety. If a retail establishment wishes to\nuse an ROP process with different time-temperature parameters from those provided in\nSection 3-502.12 of the Food Code, microbiological inoculation studies should be\nperformed by, or in conjunction with, an appropriate process authority or person\nknowledgeable in food microbiology who is acceptable to the regulatory authority.\n(4)\t Consumer Handling Practices and In-Home Refrigerator\n\nTemperatures\n\nExtended shelf life provided by ROP is cause for concern because of the potential for\nabuse by the consumer. Consumers often cannot, or do not, maintain adequate\nrefrigeration of time/temperature control for safety foods at home. Under the best of\ncircumstances, home refrigerators can be expected to range between 5o and 10o\nC (41o\n\u00ad\n50o\nF). One study reported that home refrigerator temperatures in 21% of the\nhouseholds surveyed were 10o\nC (50o\nF). Another study reported more than 1 of 4 home\nrefrigerators are above 7.2o\nC (45o\nF) and almost 1 of 10 are above 10o\nC (50o\nF). Thus,\nrefrigeration alone cannot be relied on for ensuring microbiological safety after foods in\nROP leave the establishment.\nAnnex 6 \u2013 Food Processing Criteria",

    "content": "Annex 6 \u2013 Food Processing Criteria\n\nConsumers have come to expect that certain packages of foods would be safe without\nrefrigeration. Low-acid canned foods have been thermally processed, which renders\nthe food shelf-stable. Retort heating ensures the destruction of C. botulinum spores\nas well as all other foodborne pathogens. Yet consumers may not understand that\nmost products that are packaged in ROP are not commercially sterile or shelf-stable\nand must be refrigerated. A clear label statement to keep the product refrigerated must\nbe provided to consumers.\nThe use of ROP has been extensively studied by regulators and the food industry over\nthe past several years. Recommendations have been adapted from the Association of\nFood and Drug Officials \"Retail Guidelines - Refrigerated Foods in Reduced Oxygen\nPackages\" and New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets \"Proposed\nReduced Oxygen Packaging Regulations.\" As provided in the Food Code, some ROP\noperations may be conducted under provision 3-502.12 Reduced Oxygen Packaging,\nCriteria. Food that is packaged by an ROP method under these provisions is\nconsidered safe while it is under the control of the establishment and, if the labeling\ninstructions are followed, while under the control of the consumer.\n(E) Safety Barrier Verification\nThe safety barriers for all ROP processed foods under a variance at retail must be\nverified in writing. Independent laboratory analysis using methodology approved by the\nregulatory authority such as official methods of the AOAC International (AOAC) can\nalso be used to verify incoming product. ROP processed foods which comply with one\nof the methods in Section 3-502.12 do not require written verification.\nAny changes in product formulation or processing procedures should be reflected in the\nHACCP plan and may require further product testing for validation. A record of all safety\nbarrier verifications should be updated every 12 months. This record must be available to\nthe regulatory authority for review at the time of inspection.\n(F) USDA Process Exemption\nMeat and poultry products cured at a food processing plant regulated by the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture using substances specified in 9 CFR 424, Preparation and\nProcessing Operations, are exempt from the safety barrier verification requirements.\nOther ROP operations may be developed that do not meet the provisions of Section\n3-502.12 of the Code and that will require a variance and prior approval by the\nregulatory authority under Section 3-502.\n\n11. Annex 6 \u2013 Food Processing Criteria\n\n(G) Recommendations for ROP Without Multiple Barriers\n(1) Employee Training\nIf ROP is used in a food establishment, employees assigned to packaging of the foods\nmust have documented proof that demonstrates familiarity with ROP guidelines in this\nAnnex and the potential hazards associated with these foods. A description of the\ntraining and course content provided to the employees must either be available for\nreview or have prior approval by the regulatory authority.\n(2) Refrigeration Requirements\nRefrigeration times and temperatures to inhibit C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes\nmust be based on laboratory inoculation study data or follow one of the ROP methods\nin Section 3-502.12 which specifies the time and temperature combinations. The ROP\npackage must be marked with a use-by date within either the manufacturer's labeled\nuse-by date or as determined by the laboratory data, whichever comes first.\nAlternatively, foods packaged by ROP may be kept frozen if freezing is used as the\ndeclared primary safety barrier.\n(3) Labeling - Refrigeration Statements\nAll foods offered for sale in ROP which rely on refrigeration at 5o\nC (41o\nF) or less as a\nbarrier to microbial growth must bear the statement \"Important - Must be kept\nrefrigerated at 5o\nC (41o\nF)\" or \"Important - Must be kept frozen,\" in the case of foods\nwhich rely on freezing as a primary safety barrier. The statement must appear on the\nprincipal display panel in bold type on a contrasting background. Foods packaged using\ncook chill or sous vide processing methods which have lower refrigeration requirements\nbelow 5o\nC (41o\nF) as a condition of safe shelf life must be monitored for temperature\nhistory and must not be offered for retail sale in the package or sold to a different\nbusiness entity. The labeling statement regarding cold holding temperatures is not\nrequired for food packaged using cook chill or sous vide processing.\n(4) Labeling - \"Use-by date\"\nThe shelf life of ROP foods is based on storage temperature for a certain time and\nother intrinsic factors of the food (pH, aw, cured with salt and nitrite, high levels of\ncompeting organisms, organic acids, natural antibiotics or bacteriocins, salt,\npreservatives, etc.). Each package of food in ROP must bear a \"use-by\" date. In some\ncases such as cook chill or sous vide processing when none of these intrinsic factors\nare present, a temperature lower than 3\u00baC (38\u00baF) must be the controlling factor for C.\nbotulinum and L. monocytogenes growth and/or toxin formation. This \u201cuse by\u201d date\ncannot exceed the number of days specified in one of the ROP methods in Section 3\n502.12 or must be based on laboratory inoculation studies. The date assigned by a\nretail repacker cannot extend beyond the manufacturer's recommended expiration or\n\"pull date\" for the food. The \"use-by\" date must be listed on the principal display panel\n\u00ad\nAnnex 6 \u2013 Food Processing Criteria",

Any label\non packages intended for consumer sale must contain a combination of a \"sell-by\" date\nand use-by instructions which makes it clear that the product must be consumed within\nthe number of days determined to be safe as specified under Section 3-502.12 of the\nFood Code. Foods, especially fish, that are frozen before or immediately after\npackaging and remain frozen until use should bear a label statement, \u201cImportant, keep\nfrozen until used, thaw under refrigeration immediately before use.\u201d Raw meat and\npoultry packaged using ROP methods must be labeled with safe handling instructions\nfound in 9 CFR 317.2(l) and 9 CFR 381.125(b).\n(H)\t Foods Which Require a Variance Under Code Section 3-502.11 if Packaged\nin Reduced Oxygen Atmosphere\n(1) Unfrozen processed fish and smoked fish may not be packed by ROP\nunless retail food establishments have an approved variance application and\nHACCP plan to show C. botulinum spore germination and toxin production or\nL. monocytogenes growth will not occur and are inspected by the regulatory\nauthority. Establishments packaging such fish products, and smoking and\npacking establishments, must be licensed in accordance with applicable law.\n(2) Soft cheeses such as ricotta, cottage cheese, cheese spreads, and\ncombinations of cheese with other ingredients such as vegetables, meat, or fish\nat retail must be approved for ROP through an approved variance application\nand HACCP plan and be inspected by the regulatory authority.\n(3) Meat or poultry products which are smoked or cured at retail, except that raw\nfood of animal origin which is cured in a USDA-regulated processing plant, or\nestablishment approved by the regulatory authority to cure these foods, may be\nsmoked in accordance with approved time/temperature requirements and\npackaged in ROP at retail if approved by the regulatory authority. Smoking\nwhich meets the time/temperature parameters in Section 3-401.11 does not\nrequire a variance. Cold smoking where the temperature achieved by the\nproduct is greater than 41\u00baF requires a variance. Curing using nitrite or nitrate\nalways requires a variance.\n(I)\t Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) Operation\nAll food establishments packaging food in a reduced oxygen atmosphere must develop\na HACCP plan and maintain the plan at the processing site for review by the regulatory\nauthority. For ROP operations, the plan must include the requirements specified under\n\u00b6 8-201.14(D). In addition, the HACCP plan may also include:\n(1) A complete description of the processing, packaging, and storage\nprocedures designated as critical control points, with attendant critical limits,\ncorrective action plans, monitoring and verification schemes, and records\nrequired;\nAnnex 6 \u2013 Food Processing Criteria\n\n(2) A list of equipment and food-contact packaging supplies used, including\ncompliance standards that may be required by the regulatory authority, i.e., a\nrecognized third party equipment evaluation organization such as NSF\nInternational;\n(3) A description of the lot identification system;\n(4) A description of the employee training program;\n(5) A listing and proportion of food-grade gasses used; and\n(6) A standard operating procedure for method and frequency of cleaning and\nsanitizing food-contact surfaces in the designated processing area.\n(J) Precautions Against Contamination at Retail\nOnly unopened packages of commercially processed, ready-to-eat deli meats or\ncheeses obtained from sources that comply with the applicable laws relating to food\nsafety should be used for ROP packaging at retail. If it is necessary to stop packaging\nfor a period in excess of one-half hour, the remainder of that product should be diverted\nfor another use in the retail establishment. Cook chill products that are cooked before\npackaging (ready-to-eat) should also be protected from cross-contamination before\nbeing packaged.\n(K) Disposition of Expired Product at Retail\nProcessed reduced oxygen foods that exceed the \"use-by\" date or manufacturer's \"pull\ndate\" cannot be sold in any form and must be disposed of in a proper manner.\n(L) Dedicated Area/Restricted Access\nAll aspects of reduced oxygen packaging shall be conducted in an area specifically\ndesignated for this purpose. There shall be an effective separation to prevent cross\ncontamination between raw and cooked foods. Access to processing equipment shall\nbe restricted to responsible trained personnel who are familiar with the potential\nhazards inherent in food packaged by an ROP method. Some ROP procedures such\nas sous vide may require a \"sanitary zone\" or dedicated room with restricted access to\nprevent contamination.\n(M) References\n1.

SMOKING AND CURING\n(A) Introduction\nMeat and poultry are cured by the addition of salt alone or in combination with one or\nmore ingredients such as sodium nitrite, sugar, curing accelerators, and spices. These\nare used for partial preservation, flavoring, color enhancement, tenderizing and\nimproving yield of meat. The process may include dry curing, immersion curing, direct\naddition, or injection of the curing ingredients. Curing mixtures are typically composed\nof salt (sodium chloride), sodium nitrite, and seasonings. The preparation of curing\nmixtures must be carefully controlled. A number of proprietary mixtures which are\nuniform in composition are available. The maximum residual sodium nitrite in the\nfinished product is limited to 200 ppm by the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service\n(FSIS). A sodium nitrite concentration of 120 ppm is usually sufficient for most\npurposes. Specific requirements for added nitrite may be found in USDA regulations, 9\nCFR 424. It is important to use curing methods which achieve uniform distribution of\nthe curing mixture in the meat or poultry product.\n(B) Definitions\nCured meat and poultry can be divided into three basic categories: (1) uncomminuted\nsmoked products; (2) sausages; and (3) uncomminuted unsmoked processed meats.\n(1) Uncomminuted smoked products - include bacon, beef jerky, hams, pork\nshoulders, turkey breasts, turkey drumsticks.\n(2) Sausages - include both finely ground and coarse ground products. Finely\nground sausages include bologna, frankfurters, luncheon meats and loaves,\nsandwich spreads, and viennas. Coarse ground sausages include chorizos,\nkielbasa, pepperoni, salami, and summer sausages.\n(3) Cured sausages - may be categorized as: (1) raw, cured; (2) cooked,\nsmoked; (3) cooked, unsmoked; and (4) dry, semidry, or fermented.\n(4) Uncomminuted, unsmoked processed products - include corned beef,\npastrami, pig's feet, corned tongues. This category of products may be sold as\neither raw ready-to-cook or ready-to-eat.\nAnnex 6 \u2013 Food Processing Criteria\n\n(C) Incorporation of Cure Ingredients\nRegardless of preparation method, cure ingredients must be distributed throughout the\nproduct. Cure ingredients may be introduced into sausage products during mixing or\ncomminuting. Proper and thorough mixing is necessary whether the cure is added to\nthe formulation in dry or solution form. Muscle cuts may be cured by immersion into a\ncuring (pickle) solution. These methods depend on slow diffusion of the curing agents\nthrough the product. Products must be properly refrigerated during immersion curing.\nSeveral methods may be used to shorten curing times. These include hot immersion\ncuring greater than 49o\nC (>120o\nF), injection by arterial pumping (e.g., hams), and stitch\npumping by a series of hollow needles. If the injection method is used, injection\nneedles must be frequently monitored during processing to ensure that they are not\nfouled or plugged.\nTumbling or massaging may also be used as an aid to hasten curing. Proper sanitation\nmust be observed to prevent contamination during this operation.\nThe dry curing method, a similar process, may also be used. In this case, curing\ningredients are rubbed over cuts and surfaces of meat held under refrigeration.\nPrecautions must include wearing sanitary gloves when meat is handled. Product\ntemperature maintenance is critical.\n(D) Smoking\nSmoking is the process of exposing meat products to wood smoke. Depending on the\nmethod, some products may be cooked and smoked simultaneously, smoked and dried\nwithout cooking, or cooked without smoking. Smoke may be produced by burning wood\nchips or using an approved liquid smoke preparation. Liquid smoke preparations may\nalso be substituted for smoke by addition directly onto the product during formulation in\nlieu of using a smokehouse or another type of smoking vessel. As with curing\noperations, a standard operating procedure must be established to prevent\ncontamination during the smoking process.\n(E) Fermentation and Dehydration\nMeat may be fermented or dehydrated for preservation. The purpose of fermentation is\nto reduce the pH to below 4.6 and inhibit bacteria harmful to health as well as bacteria\nwhich can cause spoilage. Meat products may also be cured and then dehydrated to\nprevent germination and growth of bacterial spores. Many fermented and dehydrated\nmeats are made without a cooking step. Sanitary practices in the production of these\nproducts are extremely important because Staphylococcus aureus can be introduced.\nStaphylococcus aureus produces an enterotoxin that is heat stable and thus will not\nbe inactivated by subsequent cooking.\nAnnex 6 \u2013 Food Processing Criteria\n\nProcessed pork products require treatment to destroy Trichinella spiralis. At retail,\nproducts which contain raw pork and which are not subsequently cooked must be\nproduced from certified trichina-free pork or treated to destroy trichinae. USDA\nregulations, 9 CFR 318.10(c)(3), establish various requirements for destroying trichina\nin pork by heating, freezing, drying, or smoking.\nSome fermented and dry cured products are processed without cooking. The labeling\nfor these products should include instructions to the consumer to cook thoroughly\nbefore consumption.\n(F) Recommendations for Safe Curing of Meat and Poultry\n(1) Posting of Acceptable Products\nA list of products approved by the regulatory authority, or by an approved\nknowledgeable authority on curing acceptable to the regulatory authority, must be\nposted in the processing area of the establishment.\n(2) Employee Training\nEmployees assigned to cure meat or poultry must demonstrate familiarity with these\nguidelines and the potential hazards associated with curing foods. A description of the\ntraining and course content provided to the employees must be available for review by\nthe regulatory authority.\n(3) HACCP\nA HACCP plan is needed for all curing operations. The following recommendations\nmust be met to cure meat and poultry products in the establishment. References are\navailable from local USDA extension offices, public libraries, and college or university\nfood or meat science departments to develop HACCP plans for curing meat and\npoultry.\n\n(a) Critical Control Points\nThe following are critical control points to be addressed:\n\n(i) Purchase of prepared cure mixes; or\n(ii) If cure mixes are blended on the premises instead of acquired\npre-mixed, mixing must be carefully controlled by using calibrated\nweighing devices.\nAnnex 6 \u2013 Food Processing Criteria\n\n(iii)\t Cure ingredients must be stored in a dry location. Cure must be\ndiscarded if the package is wet or appears to have been wetted.",

Curing may not be used to salvage meat that\nhas excessive bacterial growth or spoilage.\n\n(c) Formulating, Preparation and Curing\n(i)\t A formulation and preparation procedure must be\ndocumented.\n\n(ii)\t All equipment and utensils must be cleaned and sanitized.\n(iii) Pieces must be prepared to uniform sizes to ensure uniform cure\npenetration. This is extremely critical for dry and immersion curing.\n(iv)\t Calibrated scales must be used to weigh ingredients.\n\n(v) A schedule or recipe must be established for determining the exact\namount of curing formulation to be used for a specified weight of meat or\nmeat mixture.\n(vi) Methods and procedures must be strictly controlled to ensure\nuniform cure.\n(vii) Mixing of curing formulation with comminuted ingredients must be\ncontrolled and monitored.\n(viii) All surfaces of meat must be rotated and rubbed at intervals of\nsufficient frequency to ensure cure penetration when a dry curing method\nis used.\n(ix) Immersion curing requires periodic mixing of the batch to facilitate\nuniform curing.\nAnnex 6 \u2013 Food Processing Criteria\n\n(x) The application of salt during dry curing of muscle cuts requires\nthat the temperature of the product be strictly controlled between 1.7\u00b0C\n(35o\nF) and 7.2\u00b0C (45o\nF). The lower temperature is set to limit microbial\ngrowth and the upper temperature is set for the purpose of ensuring cure\npenetration. Refer to USDA regulations 9 CFR 318.10(c)(3)(iv) for\nspecific details on dry curing.\n(xi) Curing solutions must be discarded daily unless they remain with\nthe same batch of product during its entire curing process.\n(xii) Injection needles must be inspected for plugging when stitch\npumping or artery pumping of muscle cuts is performed.\n(xiii) Sanitary casings must be provided for sausage, chub or loaf\nforming.\n(xiv) Casings may not be stripped for reuse in forming additional chubs\nor sausages from batch to batch.\n(xv) Hot curing of bacon bellies, hams, or any other products must be\nperformed at >49\u00b0C (120o\nF) as specified in 9 CFR 318.\n\n(d) Cooking and/or Smoking\n(i) When smokehouses are initially installed or structurally modified,\ncalibration of product heating characteristics must be ascertained by\ncompetent food technologists. Tests should be run with full range of\nanticipated product loading. Verification of even airflow and moisture\nshould be recorded in operational records of the smokehouse for these\nvarious loads.\n(ii) Procedures for delivering the appropriate thermal treatment of\ncooked meats in conformance with the Food Code must be developed\nand used. (Also see 9 CFR 318.17 and 318.23 for USDA requirements for\nmeat products.) A minimum of 73.9\u00b0C (165\u00b0F) should be used for cured\npoultry products.\n(iii) Cooking equipment that provides even temperature control of the\nheating medium must be used.\n(iv) Products must be adequately separated to prevent overlap in the\ncooking media whether immersed in hot water, sprayed with hot water,\nsteamed, or oven heated.\n\n(v) Calibrated temperature measuring devices must be used for\nAnnex 6 \u2013 Food Processing Criteria\n\ndetermining internal product temperatures.\n(vi) Temperature measuring device probes must be sanitized to\nprevent contaminating products when internal temperatures are\nmeasured.\n(vii) Calibrated temperature measuring devices must be used for\nmeasuring temperatures of the heating medium.\n(viii) Raw products must be separated from cooked products.\n(ix) Time/temperature parameters of the cooking process must be\nmonitored and recorded. In some processes, the heating medium\ntemperature should also monitored.\n\n(e) Cooling\n(i) Cooling must be done in accordance with recommendations in the\nFood Code or under a variance. The USDA Cooling Guideline, FSIS\nDirective 7110.3 for special procedures for cured products, provides\nspecific guidance.\n(ii) Written cooling procedures must be established.\n(iii) Chill water used in water sprays or immersion chilling which is in\ndirect contact with products in casings or products cooked in an\nimpervious package must be properly chlorinated.\n(iv) Chill water temperature must be monitored and controlled.\n\n(v) Chill water may not be reused until properly chlorinated.\nReclaimed chill water must be discarded daily.\n(vi) Product must be placed in a manner that allows chilled water or air\nto uniformly contact the product for assurance of uniform cooling.\n(vii) Internal temperatures must be monitored during cooling by using\ncalibrated temperature measuring devices.\n(viii) Adequate cooling medium circulation must be maintained and\nmonitored.\n(ix) Temperatures of the cooling medium must be monitored and\nrecorded in accordance with a written procedure.\n\n(x) Handling of product must be minimized during cooling, peeling of\nAnnex 6 \u2013 Food Processing Criteria\n\ncasing, and packaging. Sanitary gloves must be used in these\nprocedures.\n\n(f) Fermentation and Drying\n(i) Temperature and time must be controlled and logs must be\nmaintained that record the monitoring of this process.\n(ii) Humidity must be controlled by use of a humidistat. Monitoring of\nthe process must be recorded in a written log.\n(iii) Product must be kept separated to allow adequate air circulation\nduring the process.\n(iv) Use of an active and pure culture must be ensured to effect a rapid\npH drop of the product. Use of commercially produced culture is\nnecessary and the culture must be used according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions.\n\n(v) Determination of the pH of fermented sausages at the end of the\nfermentation cycle must be recorded.\n(vi) Handling of products must be minimized and only done with\nsanitary gloves or sanitized utensils.\n(vii) Dry (unfermented) products may not be hot smoked until the curing\nand drying procedures are completed.\n(viii) Semi-dry fermented sausage must be heated after fermentation to\na time/temperature sufficient to control growth of pathogenic and spoilage\norganisms of concern.\n(4) Dedicated Area/Restricted Access\nAll aspects of curing operations must be conducted in an area specifically designated\nfor this purpose. There must be an effective separation to prevent cross contamination\nbetween raw and cooked foods or cured and uncured foods. Access to processing\nequipment shall be restricted to responsible trained personnel who are familiar with the\npotential hazards inherent in curing foods.\n(5) Equipment Cleaning and Sanitizing\nThe procedures for cleaning and sanitization must be accomplished according to parts\n4-6 and 4-7 of the Food Code.\nAnnex 6 \u2013 Food Processing Criteria\n\n(G) References\nJudge, M., E.

RISK FACTORS AND INTERVENTIONS\nRisk factors are food preparation practices and employee behaviors most commonly reported to the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as contributing factors in foodborne illness outbreaks.\nRisk factors include: Food from Unsafe Sources, Improper Holding Temperatures, Inadequate Cooking,\nContaminated Equipment, and Poor Personal Hygiene. These items are prominent on the Food\nEstablishment Inspection Report because maintaining these items in compliance is vital to preventing\nfoodborne illness. Additionally, five key public health interventions were introduced in the 1993 Food Code\nthat supplemented the other interventions long-established by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nmodel codes and guidances to protect consumer health. The five key interventions are: Demonstration of\nKnowledge, Employee Health Controls, Controlling Hands as a Vehicle of Contamination, Time and\n\nGUIdahoE 3-B Instructions for Marking the Food Establishment Inspection Report \u2013 page 3\nTemperature Parameters for Controlling Pathogens, and the Consumer Advisory.\nFor each item on the inspection report form in the Foodborne Illness Risk Factors and Public Health\nInterventions section, the inspector should indicate one of the following for COMPLIANCE STATUS: \u201cIN\u201d\nwhich means that the item is in compliance; \u201cOUT\u201d which means that the item is not in compliance;\n\u201cN.O.\u201d which means that the item was not observed during the inspection; or \u201cN.A.\u201d which means that the\nitem is not applicable for the facility. If N.A. or N.O. is not listed as an option for a particular item, this\nmeans that this item must be evaluated during the inspection and a compliance status must be\ndetermined. If the item is marked \u201cOUT\u201d, document details of each violation for the item number in\nthe \u201cObservations and Corrective Actions\u201d section on the second page of the inspection report.\nCompliance status should be determined as a result of observations that establish a pattern of non\ncompliance. Consideration should be given to the seriousness of the observation with regard to\nprevention of foodborne illness.\n\u00ad\nFor items marked \u201cOUT,\u201d further indicate the status of the violation by marking an \u201cX\u201d in the\ncorresponding box for Corrected On-Site (COS) during the inspection and/or Repeat violation (R). Marking\nCOS indicates that all violations cited under that particular item number have been corrected and verified\nbefore completing the inspection. The actual corrective action taken for each violation should be\ndocumented in the \u201cObservations and Corrective Actions\u201d section of the inspection report. For example,\nItem #10 Handwashing sink is marked out of compliance because the establishment does not have soap\nand paper towels at the handwashing sink. The person in charge partially corrects the problem by putting\nsoap at the sink, but does not replace the paper towels or provide any other effective means for drying\nhands. The corrective action taken for the soap is documented in the narrative on the form, but COS is\nnot marked for Item #10 because all violations under that item were not corrected. Marking R indicates\nthat the same violation under a particular item number was cited on the last inspection report. Using the\nsame scenario, on the subsequent inspection if the provision of soap and paper towels is not in violation,\nbut employees are not washing hands in the correct sink (which is also cited under Item #8 Handwashing\nsink), R would not be marked because this is a new violation which was not cited on the previous\ninspection report.\nC. MARKING INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH RISK FACTOR AND INTERVENTION ON THE\nINSPECTION REPORT\nSupervision\n1. PIC present, demonstrates knowledge, and performs duties\nIN/OUT\t This item must be marked IN or OUT of compliance. The person in charge (PIC) has three\nassigned responsibilities \u2013 Presence; Demonstration of Knowledge; and Duties. This item is\nmarked OUT of compliance if any one of the responsibilities is not met.\nA.\t Person in charge is present. This item is marked OUT of compliance if there is no PIC\nper 2-101.11(A) and (B).\nB.\t Demonstration of Knowledge. The PIC has three options for demonstrating knowledge.\nThis item is marked IN compliance if the PIC meets at least one of the options.

The inspector should assess this item by asking\nopen-ended questions that would evaluate the PIC's knowledge in each of the areas\nenumerated in \u00b6 2-102.11(C)(1), (4)-(16). Questions can be asked during the initial\ninterview, menu review, or throughout the inspection as appropriate. The Inspector\nshould ask a sufficient number of questions to enable the inspector to make an\ninformed decision concerning the PIC's knowledge of the Code requirements and\npublic health principles as they apply to the operation. The dialogue should be\nextensive enough to reveal whether or not that person is enabled by a clear\nunderstanding of the Code and its public health principles to follow sound food safety\npractices and to produce foods that are safe, wholesome, unadulterated, and\naccurately represented.\nC.\t Duties of the PIC. This item must be marked IN or OUT of compliance based on the\ninteraction and observation with the PIC and food employee.

This is accomplished by 1)\ndiscussion with the PIC, and 2) verified through observation that the systems or controls\nare actually being implemented. This concept is commonly referred to as Active\nManagerial Control. This item must be marked OUT of compliance when there is a\npattern of non-compliance and obvious failure by the PIC to ensure employees are\ncomplying with the duties listed in \u00a7 2-103.\n\n11. Since marking this item out of compliance\nrequires judgment, it is important that this item not be marked for an isolated incident, but\nrather for an overall evaluation of the PIC's ability to ensure compliance with the duties\ndescribed in \u00a7 2-103.\n\n11.

Proper cooling time and temperatures\nNOTE:\t The requirement for cooling cooked TCS food, is that the food must be cooled from 135\u00b0F to\n41\u00b0F or less in 6 hrs provided that the food is cooled from 135\u00b0F to 70\u00b0F within the first 2\nhours. For example, if a facility cools chili from 135\u00b0F to 70\u00b0F in 1.5 hours; they then have 4.5\nhours to get it from 70\u00b0F to 41\u00b0F or less. There are two critical limits that must be met with\ncooling. Discussions with the person in charge along with observations should be used to\ndetermine compliance. For instance, during discussion the person in charge says that a food\nproduct was cooled overnight in the walk-in cooler. The product is checked and the\ntemperature is 50\u00b0F. Eight hours have elapsed from closing to opening. This item should be\nmarked OUT because the product did not cool from 135\u00b0F to 70\u00b0F within two hours and from\n135\u00b0F to 41\u00b0F or less within a total of 6 hours. Temperatures IN compliance and OUT of\ncompliance should be recorded in the \u201cTemperature Observations\u201d section of the inspection\nreport. If there is insufficient space for the number of temperatures taken, additional\ntemperatures should be documented in the \u201cObservations and Corrective Actions\u201d section of\nthe inspection report. Because the entire cooling process is difficult to observe during an\ninspection, at the onset of the inspection a determination of whether foods are currently being\ncooled should be made. If cooling is taking place, temperatures should be taken to make a\ndetermination of whether proper cooling is possible with procedures being used.\nIN/OUT\t This item should be marked IN or OUT of compliance based on actual temperatures of TCS\nfoods in the cooling process. The basis for determining IN or OUT of compliance can also be\nsupported through discussion and/or record review which would provide the inspector reliable\ndata of the \u201cstart time\u201d for cooling from 135\u00b0F. See above NOTE for an example of using\nactual temperature and discussion with the PIC in determining OUT of compliance without\nactually being at the establishment during the entire cooling of TCS process, from start to\nfinish.\nN.A.\t This item may be marked N.A. when the establishment does not receive raw eggs, shellstock,\nor milk, prepares no TCS food from ambient temperature ingredients that require cooling, and\ndoes not cool cooked TCS food.\nN.O.\t This item may be marked N.O. when the establishment does cool TCS food, but proper cooling\nper the prescribed temperature and time parameters cannot be determined during the length of\nthe inspection.\nApplicable Code Sections:",

MARKING INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH GOOD RETAIL PRACTICE (GRP) ON THE INSPECTION\nREPORT\nGood Retail Practices (GRPs) are systems to control basic operational and sanitation conditions within a\nfacility, and if not controlled, they could be contributing factors to foodborne illness by introducing hazards\n(biological, chemical and physical), into the end product, either directly or indirectly. For example,\nequipment in disrepair, such as a cutting board with deep grooves/cuts, makes effective cleaning difficult\nor impossible, and thereby could introduce a bacterial hazard onto food that comes into contact with the\nboard. In addition, in assessing GRPs, it is important to make an overall assessment of the conditions by\nlooking for trends versus an isolated incident; and the potential public health impact. For example, a few\nmissing floor tiles in a dry area may not rise to the level of a \u201cviolation\u201d; however, missing floor tiles in an\narea where equipment is subject to in-place manual cleaning without the use of an enclosed clean in place\n(CIP) system, i.e., using pressure hoses over band saws, slicers, or mixers, could create conditions\nwhereby a bacterial hazard could be introduced on to the food equipment. These items usually require\njudgment, and if uncorrected, the regulatory authority must decide whether or not these conditions would\nlead to potential contamination.\nGRPs are the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, the receiving, preparation, storage,\nserving, packaging or holding of food which are designed to assure unsanitary conditions do not lead to\nthe introduction of hazards or unintentional substances into the end product. The intention of this\ninspection form is to focus the inspector\u2019s attention on those factors that have been shown to be most\noften linked with causing foodborne illness. Since the major emphasis of an inspection should be on the\nRisk Factors that cause foodborne illness and the Public Health interventions that have the greatest\nimpact on preventing foodborne illness, the GRPs have been given less importance on the inspection\nform and a differentiation between IN, OUT, N.A. and N.O. is not made in this area, with a few exceptions\nnoted below. For marking the GRPs section, place an \u201cX\u201d in the box to the left of the numbered item if a\ncode provision under that item is OUT of compliance. Document each violation of the code provision for\nthe item number in the \u201cObservations and Corrective Actions\u201d section on the second page of the\ninspection report. For items marked OUT of compliance, further indicate the VIOLATION STATUS by\nmarking an \u201cX\u201d in the corresponding box: COS = Corrected on site during inspection and R = Repeat\nviolation per the same instructions as given in the Risk Factor section. References to the appropriate Food\nCode provisions that can be debited under each numbered GRP item are listed in Guide 3-B.\nNote: Items 30, 32, and 33 will allow for either three or four marking options. Item 30 allows for IN OUT\nor N.A., and items 32 and 33 allow for IN, OUT, N.A .or N.O. For marking in the GRP Section place an\n\u201cA\u201d in the box to the left of the numbered item if the code provision under that item is not applicable or\nand \u201cO\u201d for not observed.\nE. TEMPERATURE OBSERVATIONS\nItem/location Record the common name of the food as well as the condition, process, and location of\nthe food at the time of monitoring e.\n\ng. hot holding, refrigerator, prep-table. Temperatures\nin compliance and out of compliance should be documented. If there is insufficient space\nfor the number of temperatures taken, record the additional temperatures in the\n\u201cObservations and Corrective Actions\u201d section of the inspection report.\n\nGUIdahoE 3-B Instructions for Marking the Food Establishment Inspection Report \u2013 page 20\nFood\nTemperature\t Record the temperature indicated on the inspector\u2019s thermometer. Specify the\nmeasurement in \u00b0F or \u00b0C. (Note: Food temperature measuring devices that are scaled\nonly in Fahrenheit should be accurate to \u00b12\u00b0F in the intended range of use. Food\ntemperature measuring devices that are scaled only in Celsius or dually scaled in Celsius\nand Fahrenheit should be accurate to \u00b1 1\u00b0C in the intended range of use.)\nF. OBSERVATIONS AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS\nInclude here specific descriptions of violations observed and recorded in the Risk Factors and\nInterventions section and Good Retail Practices check boxes. Also include corrective actions for the\nnoted violations and temperatures if there is insufficient space in the allotted section for temperature\nrecordings.\nG. SIGNATURE BLOCK\nPerson in Charge The PIC is the individual present at a food establishment who is responsible for\nthe operation at the time of the inspection.\nInspector The Inspector is the individual conducting the inspection.\nDate The date the inspection is completed.\nFollow-up The determination of whether to conduct a reinspection or other enforcement\naction.\nFollow-up Date The date the follow-up inspection will be conducted.\nSafe Food and Water\n30. Pasteurized eggs used where required\nCertain menu items use eggs as an ingredient in the preparation of RTE foods, such as Caesar salad,\nHollandaise sauce, etc. This is verified by discussion with the PIC and food employees regarding the\nsubstitution of pasteurized egg products for raw eggs in uncooked foods, unless allowed under\n\u00b6 3-401.11(D)(2).\nApplicable Code Section:",
