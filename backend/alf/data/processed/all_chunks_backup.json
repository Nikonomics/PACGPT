Annex 1 – Compliance & Enforcement\n221\n \n\nConsequently, in this document a deliberate attempt is made to extract those provisions\nthat could conceptually be adopted as an extension of Chapter 8 if they were\ncompatible with existing, governing State and local statutes. The extracted provisions\nare numbered to sequentially follow Chapter 8 but are placed in this Annex so that\nregulatory agencies can revise them to be consistent with their statutes and their needs\nas discussed in the Recommendation, below.",

Removal of Exclusions and Restrictions\nIt is anticipated that adoption of this Code will be facilitated by the fact that:\n(A) The compliance provisions of Chapter 8 that should be an integral part of\nState or local food regulations are part of the text of the Code; and\n(B) The administrative and judicial enforcement provisions that are critical to the\nframework of a food regulatory program, but that may be repetitive or discrepant\nwhen compared to State or local statutes, are separated in this Annex.\n\n3. PRINCIPLE\nAlthough the situations necessitating escalated enforcement actions comprise a small\npercentage of those encountered by the regulator, a full spectrum of enforcement tools\nmust be available where immediate hazards exist, or where compliance is not obtained\nvoluntarily. Thus, a jurisdiction must have in place both the necessary statutory\nframework that includes a broad-based, well-defined enforcement component and\nregulations that specify the requirements within those legal authorities. It is imperative\nthat there be clearly stated and legally sound rules that include the criteria for\ncompliance and enforcement, the responsibilities of all parties, sanctions for\nnoncompliance, and due process guarantees.\n4.",

Such an assessment may involve reviewing problems\nencountered in attempts to prosecute under existing State or local provisions;\nconsidering comments received by the regulatory authority about its enforcement\nprocess; consulting with staff and legal counsel to identify gaps or weaknesses in the\nprovisions; comparing provisions with sister agencies for comprehensiveness, equity,\nand uniformity; and seeking input from outside sources that have experience in taking,\nor being the subject of, enforcement actions.

M. Comprehensive Guidelines for Food Recovery Programs\nFood recovery programs collect foods from commercial production and distribution\nchannels and redistribute them to people in need. There are food recovery efforts\ncarried out by public, private, and nonprofit organizations across the country. The\nprimary goal of food recovery programs is to collect safe and wholesome food donated\nfrom commercial sources to meet the nutritional needs of the hungry. With bipartisan support, Congress passed the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food\nDonation Act in 1996. The Act is designed to encourage the donation of food and\ngrocery products to nonprofit organizations such as homeless shelters, soup kitchens,\nand churches for distribution to hungry individuals. The Bill Emerson Good Samaritan\nFood Donation Act promotes food recovery by limiting the liability of donors to instances\nof gross negligence or intentional misconduct. Annex 2 – References\n321\n \n\nThe Guidelines are intended to provide guidance to those who want to participate in\nfood recovery programs as donors and receiving operations as well as to those who\noversee standards compliance as regulators or peer inspectors.",

Since 1990, at least 12 multi-state\nfoodborne illness outbreaks have been associated with different varieties of tomatoes. From 1998 – 2006, outbreaks associated with tomatoes made up 17% of the producerelated outbreaks reported to FDA. Salmonella has been the pathogen of concern most\noften associated with tomato outbreaks.

If infected and asymptomatic employees are not microbiologically tested, they\nwill remain undetected and could therefore extend the duration of a foodborne illness\noutbreak through continued contamination of food. The Food Code provides restriction\nor exclusion guidelines for employees that are identified through microbiological testing\nwith an infection from a listed foodborne pathogen, but are otherwise asymptomatic and\nclinically well (See section 2-201.12, Table #3). The exclusion or restriction guidelines\nare applied until the identified food employees no longer present a risk for foodborne\npathogen transmission. This situation describes the third level of risk in transmitting\npathogens to food.",

Some food employees or conditional employees may report a possible exposure to an\nagent. For example, a food employee may have attended a function at which the food\nemployee ate food that was associated with an outbreak of shigellosis, but the\nemployee remains well. Such individuals fall into the category of having had a potential\nexposure and present a lower risk to public health than someone who is either\nsymptomatic or who has a definitive diagnosis. They present a level of risk to public\nhealth that is greater than if they had not had the exposure. The approach taken in the\nFood Code to food employees who have had a potential exposure is based on the\nincubation times (time between exposure and the onset of symptoms) of the various\nagents. The times chosen for restriction are the upper end of the average incubation\nperiods for the specific agents. The Food Code provides restriction guidelines for food\nemployees working in facilities serving a HSP. The reasoning is that this will restrict food\nemployees only up to the time when it is unlikely they will develop symptoms. As a\nfurther protection to public health, it is recommended that such exposed food\nemployees working in facilities not serving a HSP pay particular attention to personal\nhygiene and report the onset of any symptoms (See section 2-201.12, Table #4).",

HEPATITIS A VIRUS\nHepatitis A virus (HAV) is a 27-nanometer picornavirus (positive strand RNA, nonenveloped virus). The hepatitis A virus has been classified as a member of the family\nPicornaviridae. The exact pathogenesis of HAV infection is not understood, but the\nvirus appears to invade from the intestinal tract and is subsequently transported to the\nliver. The hepatocytes are the site of viral replication and the virus is thought to be\nshed via the bile. HAV is most commonly spread by the fecal-oral route through person-to-person\ncontact. Risk factors for reported cases of hepatitis A include personal or sexual\ncontact with another case, illegal drug use, homosexual male sex contact, and travel to\nan endemic country. Common source outbreaks also can occur through ingestion of\nwater or food that has fecal contamination. However, the source of infection is not\nidentified for approximately 50% of reported cases. HAV infection is endemic in developing countries, and less common in industrialized\ncountries with good environmental sanitation and hygienic practices. In the developing\nworld, nearly all HAV infections occur in childhood and are asymptomatic or cause a\nmild illness. As a result, hepatitis A (symptomatic infection with jaundice) is rarely seen\nin the developing world.",

After correction for under-reporting and\nundiagnosed infections, an estimated 61,000 HAV infections (includes cases of\nhepatitis A as well as asymptomatic infections) occurred in 2003. HAV Immunization: Immune globulin (IG) can be used to provide passive preexposure immunoprophylaxis against hepatitis A. Protection is immediately conferred\nto an exposed individual following administration of IG, and immunity is provided for 3-5\nmonths following inoculation. IG is effective in preventing HAV infection when given as\npost-exposure immunoprophylaxis, if given within 14 days of exposure. When a food\nemployee with hepatitis A is identified, IG is often given to co-workers.

Jaundice, dark\nurine or light colored stools might be present at onset, or follow illness symptoms within\na few days. HAV infection of older children and adults is more likely to cause clinical\nillness with jaundice (i.e., hepatitis A); onset of illness is usually abrupt.

For asymptomatic infections,\nevidence of hepatitis may be detectable only through laboratory tests of liver infections\nsuch as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) tests. The disease varies in severity from a\nmild illness to a fulminant hepatitis, ranging from 1-2 weeks to several months in\nduration.

There are two different types of microbes on the hands, transient and resident\nmicrobes. Transient microbes consist of contaminating pathogens which are loosely\nattached to the skin surface and do not survive or multiply.

Resident microbes\nconsist of a relatively stable population that survive and multiply on the skin and they\nare not easily washed off the hands. Resident microbes on the hands are usually not a\nconcern for potential contamination in food service. All aspects of proper handwashing are important in reducing microbial transients on the\nhands.

It is equally important to avoid\nrecontaminating hands by avoiding direct hand contact with heavily contaminated\nenvironmental sources, such as manually operated handwashing sink faucets, paper\ntowel dispensers, and rest room door handles after the handwashing procedure.

It is important that handwashing be done only at a\nproperly equipped handwashing facility in order to help ensure that food employees\neffectively clean their hands. Handwashing sinks are to be conveniently located,\nalways accessible for handwashing, maintained so they provide proper water\ntemperatures and pressure, and equipped with suitable hand cleansers, nail brushes,\nand disposable towels and waste containers, or hand dryers. It is inappropriate to wash\nhands in a food preparation sink since this may result in avoidable contamination of the\nsink and the food prepared therein. Service sinks may not be used for food employee\nhandwashing since this practice may introduce additional hand contaminants because\nthese sinks may be used for the disposal of mop water, toxic chemicals, and a variety of\nother liquid wastes.

In the 2005 Food Code, the use of the term “hand sanitizer” was replaced by the term\n“hand antiseptic” to eliminate confusion with the term “sanitizer,” a defined term in the\nFood Code, and to more closely reflect the terminology used in the FDA Tentative Final\nMonograph for Health-Care Antiseptic Drug Products for OTC Human Use, Federal\nRegister: June 17, 1994. The term “sanitizer” is typically used to describe control of bacterial contamination of\ninert objects or articles, or equipment and utensils, and other cleaned food-contact\nsurfaces. The Food Code definition of “sanitizer” requires a minimum microbial\nreduction of 5 logs, which is equal to a 99.999% reduction. The FDA bases the 5-log\nreduction on the AOAC International’s “Official Methods of Analysis 2003,” which\nrequires a minimum 5-log reduction in microorganisms to achieve “sanitization.”\nSanitizers used to disinfect food-contact equipment and utensils can easily achieve the\n5-log reduction of microorganisms and often far exceed this minimum requirement. However, removing microorganisms from human skin is a totally different process and\nsterilization of human skin is nearly impossible to achieve without damaging the skin.",

These include the anticipated level of pathogenic bacteria in the raw product,\nthe initial temperature of the food, and the food's bulk which affects the time to achieve\nthe needed internal product temperature. Other factors to be considered include postcooking heat rise and the time the food must be held at a specified internal\ntemperature. Greater numbers and varieties of pathogens generally are found on poultry than on\nother raw animal foods. Therefore, a higher temperature, in combination with the\nappropriate time is needed to cook these products. To kill microorganisms, food must be held at a sufficient temperature for the specified\ntime. Cooking is a scheduled process in which each of a series of continuous\ntime/temperature combinations can be equally effective. For example, in cooking a\nbeef roast, the microbial lethality achieved at 112 minutes after it has reached 54.4°C\n(130°F) is the same lethality attained as if it were cooked for 4 minutes after it has\nreached 62.8°C (145°F).

Based on the Goodfellow and Brown study, a 5D reduction of organisms is achieved at\n68o\nC (155o\nF) for 15 seconds for the following foods: ratites and injected meats and\ncomminuted: fish, meat, game animals commercially raised for food, and game\nanimals that come under a USDA voluntary inspection program. Ratites such as\nostrich, emu, and rhea are included in this list of raw animals foods because when\ncooked to a temperature greater than 68o\nC (155o\nF), ratites exhibit a (metallic) \"off\"\ntaste.",

Historical Record of Cold Holding Temperature Provisions\nThe 1976 Food Service Sanitation Manual recommended 45°F as the cold holding\ntemperature. Based on the available science at the time, the 1993 Food Code lowered\nthe cold holding temperature to 41°F.\nHowever, stakeholders raised concerns that many of the refrigerators currently in place\nin food establishments would not be capable of maintaining food at that temperature. There was also concern that most of the open-top buffet and food prep table-type units\nbeing built at the time could not reliably maintain food at 41°F or less. Industry pointed\nout that operators needed to recover investments in new refrigeration equipment\npurchased just before or after a state adopted the 41°F provision. Consequently, the Conference of Food Protection (CFP) recommended the 1997 Food\nCode incorporate the option of having a 5-year phase-in period for the 41°F\nrequirement to allow for upgrading of existing equipment, and the FDA agreed.

The literature shows that lag phase duration and generation times are\nshorter at incubation temperatures below 49°C (120°F) than at 52°C (125°F). Studies\nalso suggest that temperatures that preclude the growth of C. perfringens also\npreclude the growth of B. cereus.

The deliverance of a balanced message that communicates\nfairly to all consumers and, where epidemiologically supported, attempts to place risk in\nperspective based on the consumer's health status and the food being consumed is\npart of the challenge.

The following information is to alert the\nreader to the options available to food establishments in advising consumers of the\nincreased possibility of foodborne illness when animal-derived foods are eaten raw or\nundercooked. Background:\nAlthough no specific advisory language was recommended, beginning with the 1993\nFood Code, FDA included a codified provision for a point-of-purchase consumer\nadvisory and stated in Annex 3:\n\"FDA has requested comments and will consider the responses as well as other\ninformation that is available related to the risks involved and methods of risk\ncommunication to determine what action may be necessary by FDA to effectively\ninform consumers.",

Because the first set of focus groups (conducted before the 1997 Code) were not\nreceptive to the language recommended at the 1996 Conference for Food Protection\n(CFP) meeting, that language was not included in the 1997 Code. Before the 1998\nCFP meeting, the Agency convened a second set of focus groups with a modified\napproach. The latter set expressed similar thoughts as those in the earlier set and a\npattern for consumer acceptance and receptiveness to menu-based advisories\nemerged. It became apparent that there is a general appreciation for \"disclosure\" of what\nconsumers view as \"hidden ingredients, \" for example, whether a particular menu item\ncontains raw egg. In addition to disclosure being viewed as helpful, consumers are\naccepting, if not appreciative, of a \"reminder\" that consuming raw or undercooked\nanimal-derived foods carries an increased risk of foodborne illness.

The food temperature will not necessarily match the ambient temperature of the storage\nunit; it will depend on many variables including the temperature of the food when it is\nplaced in the unit, the temperature at which the unit is maintained, and the length of\ntime the food is stored in the unit.

The Food\nCode contains provisions that were not captured in either 21 CFR 178.1010 or 40 CFR\n180.940, such as pH, temperature, and water hardness. There is need to retain these\nprovisions in the Code.

Provisions\nfor pH, temperature, and water hardness in section 4-501.114 have been validated to\nachieve sanitization; however, these parameters are not always included on EPAregistered labels.

Provisions must be provided for hand drying so that employees will not dry their hands\non their clothing or other unclean materials. Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines\n530\n \n\nIt is known that wet hands transfer bacteria more readily than dry hands. The residual\nmoisture found on the hands after washing allows for bacterial and viral transfer to food\nor solid surfaces by touch. The method in which hands are dried is a critical factor in\nreducing chances of cross-contamination by hands to food and environmental surfaces\n(Patrick et al., (1997)). With regard to the addition of air knife technology for hand drying, data reviewed by\nFDA scientists at the FDA’s National Center for Food Safety Technology (Moffitt\nCenter) demonstrates that the use of this technology in hand dryers has been found to\nbe equivalent to the hand drying treatment in existing heated-air devices. While the Food Code does not specifically address the configuration or ergonomic\ndesign of hand drying devices, technologies employing air knife systems do not appear\nto accommodate the drying of one’s arms and may not be large enough to\naccommodate surrogate prosthetic devices for hands and arms to fit within the handdryer.",

The common goal of operators and regulators of retail and food service establishments\nis to produce safe, quality food for consumers. Since the onset of regulatory oversight\nof retail and food service operations, regulatory inspections have emphasized the\nrecognition and correction of food safety violations that exist at the time of the\ninspection. Recurring violations have traditionally been handled through re-inspections\nor enforcement activities such as fines, suspension of permits, or closures.",

(C) How can foodborne illness be reduced? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Surveillance Report for 1993­\n1997, “Surveillance for Foodborne-Disease Outbreaks – United States,” identifies the\nmost significant contributing factors to foodborne illness. Five of these broad\ncategories of contributing factors directly relate to food safety concerns within retail and\nfood service establishments and are collectively termed by the FDA as “foodborne\nillness risk factors.” These five broad categories are:\n• Food from Unsafe Sources\n• Inadequate Cooking\n• Improper Holding Temperatures\n• Contaminated Equipment\n• Poor Personal Hygiene. In 1998, FDA initiated a project designed to determine the incidence of foodborne\nillness risk factors in retail and food service establishments. Inspections focusing on\nthe occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors were conducted in establishments\nthroughout the United States. The results of this project are published in the 2000\nReport of the FDA Retail Food Program Database of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors,\ncommonly referred to as the “FDA Baseline Report.” The Baseline Report is available\nfrom FDA through the following website:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/GuidanceRegulation/UCM123546.pdf.",

Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) is a systematic approach to\nidentifying, evaluating, and controlling food safety hazards. Food safety hazards are\nbiological, chemical, or physical agents that are reasonably likely to cause illness or\ninjury in the absence of their control. Because a HACCP program is designed to\nensure that hazards are prevented, eliminated, or reduced to an acceptable level before\na food reaches the consumer, it embodies the preventive nature of “active managerial\ncontrol.”\nActive managerial control through the use of HACCP principles is achieved by\nidentifying the food safety hazards attributed to products, determining the necessary\nsteps that will control the identified hazards, and implementing on-going practices or\nprocedures that will ensure safe food. Like many other quality assurance programs, HACCP provides a common-sense\napproach to identifying and controlling problems that are likely to exist in an operation.

A hazard is a biological, chemical, or physical property that may cause a food to be\nunsafe for human consumption. (2) What are biological hazards? Biological hazards include bacterial, viral, and parasitic microorganisms. See Table 1 in\nthis Annex for a listing of selected biological hazards. Bacterial pathogens comprise the\nmajority of confirmed foodborne disease outbreaks and cases. Although cooking\ndestroys the vegetative cells of foodborne bacteria to acceptable levels, spores of\nspore-forming bacteria such as Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, and Clostridium\nperfringens survive cooking and may germinate and grow if food is not properly cooled\nor held after cooking. The toxins produced by the vegetative cells of Bacillus cereus,\nClostridium botulinum, and Staphylococcus aureus may not be destroyed to safe levels\nby reheating. Post-cook recontamination with vegetative cells of bacteria such as\nSalmonellae and Campylobacter jejuni is also a major concern for operators of retail\nand food service establishments.

In limited cases, foodborne viruses\nmay occur in raw commodities contaminated by human feces (e.g., shellfish harvested\nfrom unapproved, polluted waters). In most cases, however, contamination of food by\nviruses is the result of cross-contamination by ill food employees or unclean equipment\nand utensils.

During this stage, a review is made of the ingredients\nused in the product, the activities conducted at each step in the process, the equipment\nAnnex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active\nManagerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors\n563\n \n\nused, the final product, and its method of storage and distribution, as well as the\nintended use and consumers of the product.

(3) Are the CCPs the same for everyone? Different facilities preparing similar food items may identify different hazards and the\nCCPs.

ADVANTAGES OF USING THE PRINCIPLES OF HACCP\n(A)\t What advantages does using HACCP principles offer operators of retail and\nfood service establishments? Rather than relying solely on periodic feedback from inspections by regulatory\nagencies, an establishment operator who implements a food safety management\nsystem based on HACCP principles emphasizes continuous problem solving and\nprevention. Additionally, HACCP enhances and encourages communication between\nindustry and regulators. A food safety management system based on HACCP principles offers many other\nadvantages to industry.

Traditional inspections are relatively resource-intensive, inefficient, and reactive rather\nthan preventive in nature. Using traditional inspection techniques allows for a\nsatisfactory “snapshot” assessment of the requirements of the code at the time of the\ninspection. Unfortunately, unless an inspector asks questions and inquires about the\nactivities and procedures being utilized by the establishment even at times when the\ninspector is not there, there is no way to know if an operator is achieving active\nmanagerial control. With the limited time often available for conducting inspections, regulators must focus\ntheir attention on those areas that clearly have the greatest impact on food safety –\nfoodborne illness risk factors.",

The FDA’s Voluntary National Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards (Program\nStandards)\n(http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/ProgramStandards\n/default.htm ) provide additional recommendations to assist regulatory program\nmanagers in the planning and development of a risk-based inspection program. The primary focus of this Annex is to provide inspectors with methods for conducting\nrisk-based inspections. Various strategies that can be used by regulatory professionals\nto assist operators in achieving active managerial control of foodborne illness risk\nfactors are also included in this Annex. As presented in Annex 4, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nSurveillance Report for 1993-1997, “Surveillance for Foodborne Disease Outbreaks –\nUnited States” (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss4901a1.htm ) identifies\nthe most frequently reported contributing factors to foodborne illness.",

RISK-BASED ROUTINE INSPECTIONS\nInspections have been a part of food safety regulatory activities since the earliest days\nof public health. The term \"routine inspection” has been used to describe periodic\ninspections conducted as part of an on-going regulatory scheme. Program managers should strive to have adequate staffing and resources to allow all\ninspectors ample time to thoroughly evaluate establishments and ask as many\nquestions as needed to fully understand establishments’ operations. For most\njurisdictions, however, inspectors continue to have limited time in which to complete\ninspections. This does not negate the need to thoroughly identify and assess the\ncontrol of foodborne illness risk factors during each inspection. It is a false assumption that inspectors cannot conduct risk-based inspections in a\nlimited timeframe. Even with limited time, inspectors can focus their inspections on\nassessing the degree of active managerial control an operator has over the foodborne\nillness risk factors.",

It embodies a\npreventive rather than reactive approach to food safety through a continuous system of\nmonitoring and verification. Developing and implementing food safety management systems to prevent, eliminate,\nor reduce the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors is recommended to achieve\nactive managerial control.

Each jurisdiction is encouraged\nto develop risk categories tailored to their specific program needs and resources and to\nreassess the risk categories on an annual basis. Regardless of the risk category initially assigned to food establishments, regulatory\njurisdictions sometimes consider whether the establishment has implemented a\nvoluntary food safety management system like HACCP, to justify a decrease in\ninspection frequency.

Focus the Inspection\nConducting a risk-based inspection requires inspectors to focus their efforts on\nevaluating the degree of active managerial control that operators have over foodborne\nillness risk factors. In addition, it is essential that the implementation of Food Code\ninterventions also be verified during each inspection. Inspectors need to spend the\nmajority of their time observing the behaviors, practices, and procedures that are likely\nto lead to out-of-control foodborne illness risk factors and asking management and food\nemployees questions to supplement actual observations. Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections\n594\n \n\nRetail and food service operators implement “control measures” to ensure food safety. Control measures are actions or activities that are used to prevent, eliminate, or reduce\nfood safety hazards. Inspectors need to determine the control measures that should be\nimplemented to prevent the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors in each food\npreparation process. In order to determine the foodborne illness risk factors common to\neach operation, it is important for inspectors to understand that the food preparation\nprocesses and all the associated control measures initiated by a retail or food service\noperator represent a food safety management system.",

Products packaged using ROP may be produced safely if proper controls\nare in effect. Producing and distributing these products with a HACCP approach offer\nan effective, rational, and systematic method for the assurance of food safety.

(B) Definitions\nThe term ROP can be used to describe any packaging procedure that results in a\nreduced oxygen level in a sealed package. The term is often used because it is an\ninclusive term and can include packaging options such as:\n(1) Cook-chill packaging, in which cooked food is hot filled into impermeable\nbags which have the air expelled and are then sealed or crimped closed. The\nbagged food is rapidly chilled and refrigerated at temperatures that inhibit the\ngrowth of psychrotrophic pathogens.",

These organisms are responsible for offodors, slime, and texture changes, which are signs of spoilage. ROP can be used to prevent degradation or oxidative processes in food products. Reducing the oxygen in and around a food retards the amount of oxidative rancidity in\nfats and oils. ROP also prevents color deterioration in raw meats caused by oxygen. An additional effect of sealing food in ROP is the reduction of product shrinkage by\npreventing water loss. These benefits of ROP allow an extended shelf life for vacuum packaged (VP),\nmodified atmosphere packaged (MAP) and controlled atmosphere packaged (CAP)\nfoods displayed for retail sale. Cook chill (CC) and sous vide (SV) processed food\ncannot be sold directly to consumers or other businesses but the extended shelf life\nand quality benefits internal service and use of the products.

Unless\ntime/temperature control for safety foods are protected inherently, simply placing them\nin ROP without regard to microbial growth will increase the risk of foodborne illnesses. ROP processors and regulators must assure that during distribution of foods or while\nfoods are held by retailers or consumers, refrigerated temperatures must be\nconsistently maintained. In fact, a serious concern is that the increased use of vacuum\npackaging at retail supermarket deli-type operations may be followed by temperature\nabuse in the establishment or by the consumer. Consequently, at least one barrier or\nmultiple hurdles resulting in a barrier needs to be incorporated into the production\nprocess for products packaged using ROP. The incorporation of several sub-inhibitory\nbarriers, none of which could individually inhibit microbial growth but which in\ncombination provide a full barrier to growth (the hurdle concept), is necessary to ensure\nfood safety. Some products in ROP contain no preservatives and frequently do not possess any\nintrinsic inhibitory barriers (such as, pH, aw, or salt concentrations) that either alone or\nin combination will inhibit microbial growth.

(1) Refrigerated Holding Requirements for Foods in ROP\nSafe use of ROP technology demands that adequate refrigeration be maintained during\nthe entire shelf-life of time/temperature control for safety foods to ensure product\nsafety. Bacteria, with the exception of those that can form spores, are eliminated by\npasteurization. However, pathogens may survive in the final product if pasteurization is\ninadequate, poor quality raw materials or poor handling practices are used, or postprocessing contamination occurs.",

Marginal refrigeration that does not facilitate growth may still allow\nSalmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., and Brucella spp. to survive for long periods of\ntime. Published surveys indicate that refrigeration practices at retail need improvement. Some refrigerated products offered in convenience stores were found at or above 7.2o\nC\n(45o\nF) 50% of the time; in several cases temperatures as high as 10o\nC (50o\nF) were\nobserved. Delicatessen display cases have been shown to demonstrate poor\ntemperature control. Foods have been observed above 10o\nC (50o\nF) and above 12.8o\nC\n(55o\nF) in several instances.

If it is necessary to stop packaging\nfor a period in excess of one-half hour, the remainder of that product should be diverted\nfor another use in the retail establishment. Cook chill products that are cooked before\npackaging (ready-to-eat) should also be protected from cross-contamination before\nbeing packaged. (K) Disposition of Expired Product at Retail\nProcessed reduced oxygen foods that exceed the \"use-by\" date or manufacturer's \"pull\ndate\" cannot be sold in any form and must be disposed of in a proper manner. (L) Dedicated Area/Restricted Access\nAll aspects of reduced oxygen packaging shall be conducted in an area specifically\ndesignated for this purpose. There shall be an effective separation to prevent cross\ncontamination between raw and cooked foods. Access to processing equipment shall\nbe restricted to responsible trained personnel who are familiar with the potential\nhazards inherent in food packaged by an ROP method. Some ROP procedures such\nas sous vide may require a \"sanitary zone\" or dedicated room with restricted access to\nprevent contamination. (M) References\n\n1.

SMOKING AND CURING\n(A) Introduction\nMeat and poultry are cured by the addition of salt alone or in combination with one or\nmore ingredients such as sodium nitrite, sugar, curing accelerators, and spices. These\nare used for partial preservation, flavoring, color enhancement, tenderizing and\nimproving yield of meat. The process may include dry curing, immersion curing, direct\naddition, or injection of the curing ingredients. Curing mixtures are typically composed\nof salt (sodium chloride), sodium nitrite, and seasonings. The preparation of curing\nmixtures must be carefully controlled. A number of proprietary mixtures which are\nuniform in composition are available. The maximum residual sodium nitrite in the\nfinished product is limited to 200 ppm by the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service\n(FSIS).",

A sodium nitrite concentration of 120 ppm is usually sufficient for most\npurposes. Specific requirements for added nitrite may be found in USDA regulations, 9\nCFR 424. It is important to use curing methods which achieve uniform distribution of\nthe curing mixture in the meat or poultry product. (B) Definitions\nCured meat and poultry can be divided into three basic categories: (1) uncomminuted\nsmoked products; (2) sausages; and (3) uncomminuted unsmoked processed meats. (1) Uncomminuted smoked products - include bacon, beef jerky, hams, pork\nshoulders, turkey breasts, turkey drumsticks. (2) Sausages - include both finely ground and coarse ground products. Finely\nground sausages include bologna, frankfurters, luncheon meats and loaves,\nsandwich spreads, and viennas. Coarse ground sausages include chorizos,\nkielbasa, pepperoni, salami, and summer sausages. (3) Cured sausages - may be categorized as: (1) raw, cured; (2) cooked,\nsmoked; (3) cooked, unsmoked; and (4) dry, semidry, or fermented. (4) Uncomminuted, unsmoked processed products - include corned beef,\npastrami, pig's feet, corned tongues. This category of products may be sold as\neither raw ready-to-cook or ready-to-eat.",

Cure ingredients may be introduced into sausage products during mixing or\ncomminuting. Proper and thorough mixing is necessary whether the cure is added to\nthe formulation in dry or solution form. Muscle cuts may be cured by immersion into a\ncuring (pickle) solution. These methods depend on slow diffusion of the curing agents\nthrough the product. Products must be properly refrigerated during immersion curing. Several methods may be used to shorten curing times. These include hot immersion\ncuring greater than 49o\nC (>120o\nF), injection by arterial pumping (e.g., hams), and stitch\npumping by a series of hollow needles. If the injection method is used, injection\nneedles must be frequently monitored during processing to ensure that they are not\nfouled or plugged. Tumbling or massaging may also be used as an aid to hasten curing. Proper sanitation\nmust be observed to prevent contamination during this operation. The dry curing method, a similar process, may also be used. In this case, curing\ningredients are rubbed over cuts and surfaces of meat held under refrigeration. Precautions must include wearing sanitary gloves when meat is handled.",

Meat products may also be cured and then dehydrated to\nprevent germination and growth of bacterial spores. Many fermented and dehydrated\nmeats are made without a cooking step.

MARKING INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH GOOD RETAIL PRACTICE (GRP) ON THE INSPECTION\nREPORT\nGood Retail Practices (GRPs) are systems to control basic operational and sanitation conditions within a\nfacility, and if not controlled, they could be contributing factors to foodborne illness by introducing hazards\n(biological, chemical and physical), into the end product, either directly or indirectly. For example,\nequipment in disrepair, such as a cutting board with deep grooves/cuts, makes effective cleaning difficult\nor impossible, and thereby could introduce a bacterial hazard onto food that comes into contact with the\nboard. In addition, in assessing GRPs, it is important to make an overall assessment of the conditions by\nlooking for trends versus an isolated incident; and the potential public health impact. For example, a few\nmissing floor tiles in a dry area may not rise to the level of a “violation”; however, missing floor tiles in an\narea where equipment is subject to in-place manual cleaning without the use of an enclosed clean in place\n(CIP) system, i.e., using pressure hoses over band saws, slicers, or mixers, could create conditions\nwhereby a bacterial hazard could be introduced on to the food equipment.",

This document sets guidelines for accessibility to places of public accommodation and commercial facilities by individuals with disabilities. These guidelines are to be applied during the design, construction, and alteration of such buildings and facilities to the extent required by regulations issued by Federal agencies, including the Department of Justice, under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The technical specifications 4.2 through 4.35, of these guidelines are the same as those of the American National Standard Institute's document A117.1-1980, except as noted in this text by italics. However, sections 4.1.1 through 4.1.7 and sections 5 through 10 are different from ANSI A117.1 in their entirety and are printed in standard type. The illustrations and text of ANSI A117.1 are reproduced with permission from the American National Standards Institute.",

If the person is unfamiliar with a building, if competing traffic is heavy, if sudden or frequent movements are needed, or if the wheelchair must be turned at an opening, then greater clear widths are needed. For most situations, the addition of an inch of leeway on either side is sufficient. Thus, a minimum clear width of 32 in (815 mm) will provide adequate clearance. However, when an opening or a restriction in a passageway is more than 24 in (610 mm) long, it is essentially a passageway and must be at least 36 in (915 mm) wide. (2) Space Requirements for Use of Walking Aids. Although people who use walking aids can maneuver through clear width openings of 32 in (815 mm), they need 36 in (915 mm) wide passageways and walks for comfortable gaits. Crutch tips, often extending down at a wide angle, are a hazard in narrow passageways where they might not be seen by other pedestrians. Thus, the 36 in (915 mm) width provides a safety allowance both for the person with a disability and for others. (3) Space Requirements for Passing. Able-bodied persons in winter clothing, walking straight ahead with arms swinging, need 32 in (815 mm) of width, which includes 2 in (50 mm) on either side for sway, and another 1 in (25 mm) tolerance on either side for clearing nearby objects or other pedestrians.",

If the clear width is less than 60 in (1525 mm), two wheelchair users will not be able to pass but will have to seek a wider place for passing. Forty-eight inches (1220 mm) is the minimum width needed for an ambulatory person to pass a nonambulatory or semi-ambulatory person. Within this 48 in (1220 mm) width, the ambulatory person will have to twist to pass a wheelchair user, a person with a service animal, or a semi-ambulatory person.

This assumes a rate of about 1.5 ft/s (455 mm/s) on level ground. It also assumes that the traveler would move continuously. However, on trips over 100 ft (30 m), disabled people are apt to rest frequently, which substantially increases their trip times. Resting periods of 2 minutes for every 100 ft (30 m) can be used to estimate travel times for people with severely limited stamina. In inclement weather, slow progress and resting can greatly increase a disabled person's exposure to the elements. (2) Sites.

The two principal cane techniques are the touch technique, where the cane arcs from side to side and touches points outside both shoulders; and the diagonal technique, where the cane is held in a stationary position diagonally across the body with the cane tip touching or just above the ground at a point outside one shoulder and the handle or grip extending to a point outside the other shoulder. The touch technique is used primarily in uncontrolled areas, while the diagonal technique is used primarily in certain limited, controlled, and familiar environments. Cane users are often trained to use both techniques. Potential hazardous objects are noticed only if they fall within the detection range of canes (see Fig. A4). Visually impaired people walking toward an object can detect an overhang if its lowest surface is not higher than 27 in (685 mm). When walking alongside protruding objects, they cannot detect overhangs. Since proper cane and service animal techniques keep people away from the edge of a path or from walls, a slight overhang of no more than 4 in (100 mm) is not hazardous.

Wheelchairs can be propelled most easily on surfaces that are hard, stable, and regular. Soft loose surfaces such as shag carpet, loose sand or gravel, wet clay, and irregular surfaces such as cobblestones can significantly impede wheelchair movement. Slip resistance is based on the frictional force necessary to keep a shoe heel or crutch tip from slipping on a walking surface under conditions likely to be found on the surface. While the dynamic coefficient of friction during walking varies in a complex and non-uniform way, the static coefficient of friction, which can be measured in several ways, provides a close approximation of the slip resistance of a surface. Contrary to popular belief, some slippage is necessary to walking, especially for persons with restricted gaits; a truly \"non-slip\" surface could not be negotiated. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends that walking surfaces have a static coefficient of friction of 0.5. A research project sponsored by the Architectural and\nTransportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) conducted tests with persons with disabilities and concluded that a higher coefficient of friction was needed by such persons. A static coefficient of friction of 0.6 is recommended for accessible routes and 0.8 for ramps.",

It is recognized that the coefficient of friction varies considerably due to the presence of contaminants, water, floor finishes, and other factors not under the control of the designer or builder and not subject to design and construction guidelines and that compliance would be difficult to measure on the building site. Nevertheless, many common building materials suitable for flooring are now labeled with information on the static coefficient of friction. While it may not be possible to compare one product directly with another, or to guarantee a constant measure, builders and designers are encouraged to specify materials with appropriate values. As more products include information on slip resistance, improved uniformity in measurement and specification is likely. The Access Board's advisory guidelines on Slip Resistant Surfaces provides additional information on this subject. Cross slopes on walks and ground or floor surfaces can cause considerable difficulty in propelling a wheelchair in a straight line. A4.5.3 Carpet.

When both carpet and padding are used, it is desirable to have minimum movement (preferably none) between the floor and the pad and the pad and the carpet which would allow the carpet to hump or warp. In heavily trafficked areas, a thick, soft (plush) pad or cushion, particularly in combination with long carpet pile, makes it difficult for individuals in wheelchairs and those with other ambulatory disabilities to get about. Firm carpeting can be achieved through proper selection and combination of pad and carpet, sometimes with the elimination of the pad or cushion, and with proper installation. Carpeting designed with a weave that causes a zig-zag effect when wheeled across is strongly discouraged. A4.6 Parking and Passenger Loading Zones. A4.6.3 Parking Spaces. The increasing use of vans with side-mounted lifts or ramps by persons with disabilities has necessitated some revisions in specifications for parking spaces and adjacent access aisles. The typical accessible parking space is 96 in (2440 mm) wide with an adjacent 60 in (1525 mm) access aisle.

Classes of Sleeping Accommodations\nIn tests conducted with actual lift/van/wheelchair combinations, (under a Board-sponsored Accessible Parking and Loading Zones Project) researchers found that a space and aisle totaling almost 204 in (5180 mm) wide was needed to deploy a lift and exit conveniently. The \"van accessible\" parking space required by these guidelines provides a 96 in (2440 mm) wide space with a 96 in (2440 mm) adjacent access aisle which is just wide enough to maneuver and exit from a side mounted lift. If a 96 in (2440 mm) access aisle is placed between two spaces, two \"van accessible\" spaces are created. Alternatively, if the wide access aisle is provided at the end of a row (an area often unused), it may be possible to provide the wide access aisle without additional space (see Fig. A5(a)). A sign is needed to alert van users to the presence of the wider aisle, but the space is not intended to be restricted only to vans. \"Universal\" Parking Space Design. An alternative to the provision of a percentage of spaces with a wide aisle, and the associated need to include additional signage, is the use of what has been called the \"universal\" parking space design. Under this design, all accessible spaces are 132 in (3350 mm) wide with a 60 in (1525 mm) access aisle (see Fig. A5(b)).

An essential consideration for any design is having the access aisle level with the parking space. Since a person with a disability, using a lift or ramp, must maneuver within the access aisle, the aisle cannot include a ramp or sloped area. The access aisle must be connected to an accessible route to the appropriate accessible entrance of a building or facility. The parking access aisle must either blend with the accessible route or have a curb ramp complying with 4.7. Such a curb ramp opening must be located within the access aisle boundaries, not within the parking space boundaries.

Although some people cannot manage the allowable forces in this guideline and many others have difficulty, door closers must have certain minimum closing forces to close doors satisfactorily. Forces for pushing or pulling doors open are measured with a push-pull scale under the following conditions:\n(1) Hinged doors: Force applied perpendicular to the door at the door opener or 30 in (760 mm) from the hinged side, whichever is farther from the hinge. (2) Sliding or folding doors: Force applied parallel to the door at the door pull or latch.

People over 60 years of age generally have difficulty perceiving frequencies higher than 10,000 Hz. An alarm signal which has a periodic element to its signal, such as single stroke bells (clang-pause-clang- pause), hi-low (up-down-up-down) and fast whoop (on-off-on-off) are best. Avoid continuous or reverberating tones. Select a signal which has a sound characterized by three or four clear tones without a great deal of \"noise\" in between. A4.28.3 Visual Alarms. The specifications in this section do not preclude the use of zoned or coded alarm systems. A4.28.4 Auxiliary Alarms. Locating visual emergency alarms in rooms where persons who are deaf may work or reside alone can ensure that they will always be warned when an emergency alarm is activated. To be effective, such devices must be located and oriented so that they will spread signals and reflections throughout a space or raise the overall light level sharply. However, visual alarms alone are not necessarily the best means to alert sleepers. A study conducted by Underwriters Laboratory (UL) concluded that a flashing light more than seven times brighter was required (110 candela v. 15 candela, at the same distance) to awaken sleepers as was needed to alert awake subjects in a normal daytime illuminated room.",

Classes of Sleeping Accommodations\nFor hotel and other rooms where people are likely to be asleep, a signal-activated vibrator placed between mattress and box spring or under a pillow was found by UL to be much more effective in alerting sleepers. Many readily available devices are sound-activated so that they could respond to an alarm clock, clock radio, wake-up telephone call or room smoke detector. Activation by a building alarm system can either be accomplished by a separate circuit activating an auditory alarm which would, in turn, trigger the vibrator or by a signal transmitted through the ordinary 110-volt outlet. Transmission of signals through the power line is relatively simple and is the basis of common, inexpensive remote light control systems sold in many department and electronic stores for home use. So-called \"wireless\" intercoms operate on the same principal.\nA4.29 Detectable Warnings. A4.29.2 Detectable Warnings on Walking Surfaces.

A4.30 Signage. A4.30.1 General. In building complexes where finding locations independently on a routine basis may be a necessity (for example, college campuses), tactile maps or prerecorded instructions can be very helpful to visually impaired people. Several maps and auditory instructions have been developed and tested for specific applications. The type of map or instructions used must be based on the information to be communicated, which depends highly on the type of buildings or users. Landmarks that can easily be distinguished by visually impaired individuals are useful as orientation cues. Such cues include changes in illumination level, bright colors, unique patterns, wall murals, location of special equipment or other architectural features. Many people with disabilities have limitations in movement of their heads and reduced peripheral vision. Thus, signage positioned perpendicular to the path of travel is easiest for them to notice. People can generally distinguish signage within an angle of 30 degrees to either side of the centerlines of their faces without moving their heads. A4.30.2 Character Proportion.",

The size of characters must be based upon the intended viewing distance. A severely nearsighted person may have to be much closer to recognize a character of a given size than a person with normal visual acuity. A4.30.4 Raised and Brailled Characters and Pictorial Symbol Signs (Pictograms). The standard dimensions for literary Braille are as follows:\nDot diameter .059 in. Inter-dot spacing .090 in. Horizontal separation between cells .241 in. Vertical separation between cells .395 in. Raised borders around signs containing raised characters may make them confusing to read unless the border is set far away from the characters. Accessible signage with descriptive materials about public buildings, monuments, and objects of cultural interest may not provide sufficiently detailed and meaningful information. Interpretive guides, audio tape devices, or other methods may be more effective in presenting such information. A4.30.5 Finish and Contrast.

Paragraph (a) provides that, except as otherwise specifically provided by this part, the ADA is not intended to apply lesser standards than are required under title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 790 - 794), or the regulations implementing that title. The standards of title V of the Rehabilitation Act apply for purposes of the ADA to the extent that the ADA has not explicitly adopted a different standard from title\n\nV. Where the ADA explicitly provides a different standard from section 504, the ADA standard applies to the ADA, but not to section 504. For example, section 504 requires that all federally assisted programs and activities be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps, even if major structural alterations are necessary to make a program accessible.",

For example, assume that a person with a physical disability seeks damages under a State law that allows compensatory and punitive damages for discrimination on the basis of physical disability, but does not allow them on the basis of mental disability. In that situation, the State law would provide narrower coverage, by excluding mental disabilities, but broader remedies, and an individual covered by both laws could choose to bring an action under both laws. Moreover, State tort claims confer greater remedies and are not preempted by the ADA. A plaintiff may join a State tort claim to a case brought under the ADA.

As with racial and ethnic terms, the choice of words to describe a person with a disability is overlaid with stereotypes, patronizing attitudes, and other emotional connotations. Many individuals with disabilities, and organizations representing such individuals, object to the use of such terms as \"handicapped person'' or \"the handicapped. '' In other recent legislation, Congress also recognized this shift in terminology, e.g., by changing the name of the National Council on the Handicapped to the National Council on Disability (Pub.

In enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act, Congress concluded that it was important for the current legislation to use terminology most in line with the sensibilities of most Americans with disabilities. No change in definition or substance is intended nor should be attributed to this change in phraseology.

Classes of Sleeping Accommodations\nTest C -- Being Regarded as Having Such an Impairment\nThis test, as contained in paragraph (4) of the definition, is intended to cover persons who are treated by a private entity or public accommodation as having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. It applies when a person is treated as if he or she has an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, regardless of whether that person has an impairment. The Americans with Disabilities Act uses the same \"regarded as'' test set forth in the regulations implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. See, e.g., 28 CFR 42.540(k)(2)(iv), which provides:\n(iv) \"Is regarded as having an impairment'' means (A) Has a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit major life activities but that is treated by a recipient as constituting such a limitation; (B) Has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others toward such impairment; or (C) Has none of the impairments defined in paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section but is treated by a recipient as having such an impairment.",

A person who perceives himself or herself to have an impairment, but does not have an impairment, and is not treated as if he or she has an impairment, is not protected under this test. A person would be covered under this test if a restaurant refused to serve that person because of a fear of \"negative reactions'' of others to that person. A person would also be covered if a public accommodation refused to serve a patron because it perceived that the patron had an impairment that limited his or her enjoyment of the goods or services being offered. For example, persons with severe burns often encounter discrimination in community activities, resulting in substantial limitation of major life activities. These persons would be covered under this test based on the attitudes of others towards the impairment, even if they did not view themselves as \"impaired. ''\nThe rationale for this third test, as used in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, was articulated by the Supreme Court in Arline, 480 U.S. 273 (1987). The Court noted that, although an individual may have an impairment that does not in fact substantially limit a major life activity, the reaction of others may prove just as disabling.",

This definition focuses on the actual ability of the interpreter in a particular interpreting context to facilitate effective communication between the public accommodation and the individual with disabilities. Public comment also revealed that public accommodations have at times asked persons who are deaf to provide family members or friends to interpret. In certain circumstances, notwithstanding that the family member or friend is able to interpret or is a certified interpreter, the family member or friend may not be qualified to render the necessary interpretation because of factors such as emotional or personal involvement or considerations of confidentiality that may adversely affect the ability to interpret \"effectively, accurately, and impartially.",

The list of factors included in the definition is derived from section 301(9) of the ADA. It reflects the congressional intention that a wide range of factors be considered in determining whether an action is readily achievable. It also takes into account that many local facilities are owned or operated by parent corporations or entities that conduct operations at many different sites. This section makes clear that, in some instances, resources beyond those of the local facility where the barrier must be removed may be relevant in determining whether an action is readily achievable. One must also evaluate the degree to which any parent entity has resources that may be allocated to the local facility. The statutory list of factors in section 301(9) of the Act uses the term \"covered entity'' to refer to the larger entity of which a particular facility may be a part. \"Covered entity'' is not a defined term in the ADA and is not used consistently throughout the Act.",

The religious entity would not lose its exemption merely because the services provided were open to the general public. The test is whether the church or other religious organization operates the public accommodation, not which individuals receive the public accommodation's services. Religious entities that are controlled by religious organizations are also exempt from the ADA's requirements. Many religious organizations in the United States use lay boards and other secular or corporate mechanisms to operate schools and an array of social services. The use of a lay board or other mechanism does not itself remove the ADA's religious exemption. Thus, a parochial school, having religious doctrine in its curriculum and sponsored by a religious order, could be exempt either as a religious organization or as an entity controlled by a religious organization, even if it has a lay board. The test remains a factual one -- whether the church or other religious organization controls the operations of the school or of the service or whether the school or service is itself a religious organization.",

The Department received widely differing comments in response to the preamble question asking whether landlord and tenant obligations should vary depending on the length of time remaining on an existing lease. Many suggested that tenants should have no responsibilities in \"shorter leases,'' which commenters defined as ranging anywhere from 90 days to three years.",

The Department agrees with this latter approach and will interpret the rule in that manner. In recognition of the somewhat limited applicability of the allocation scheme contained in the proposed rule, paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) have been deleted from the final rule. The Department has substituted instead a statement that allocation of responsibility as between the parties for taking readily achievable measures to remove barriers and to provide auxiliary aids and services both in common areas and within places of public accommodation may be determined by the lease or other contractual relationships between the parties. The ADA was not intended to change existing landlord/tenant responsibilities as set forth in the lease. By deleting specific provisions from the rule, the Department gives full recognition to this principle. As between the landlord and tenant, the extent of responsibility for particular obligations may be, and in many cases probably will be, determined by contract.

Many commenters objected to the proposed rule's allocation of responsibility for providing auxiliary aids and services solely to the tenant, pointing out that this exclusive allocation may not be appropriate in the case of larger public accommodations that operate their businesses by renting space out to smaller public accommodations. For example, large theaters often rent to smaller traveling companies and hospitals often rely on independent contractors to provide childbirth classes.

These commenters believed that responsibility for providing auxiliary aids should shift to the landlord, if the landlord relies on a smaller public accommodation or independent contractor to provide services closely related to those of the larger public accommodation, and if the needed auxiliary aids prove to be an undue burden for the smaller public accommodation. The final rule no longer lists specific allocations to specific parties but, rather, leaves allocation of responsibilities to the lease negotiations. Parties are, therefore, free to allocate the responsibility for auxiliary aids.

Some commenters suggested that the rule should allocate responsibilities for areas other than removal of barriers and auxiliary aids. The final rule leaves allocation of all areas to the lease negotiations. However, in general landlords should not be given responsibility for policies a tenant applies in operating its business, if such policies are solely those of the tenant.

Thus, if a private club runs a day care center that is open exclusively to its own members, the club, like the church in the example above, would have no responsibility for compliance with the ADA. Nor would the day care center have any responsibilities because it is part of the private club exempt from the ADA.

This paragraph permitting separate benefits \"when necessary'' should be read together with Sec.36.203(a), which requires integration in \"the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of the individual.''

This provision was intended to ensure that entities such as health care providers, employees of social service agencies, and others who provide professional services to persons with disabilities are not subjected to discrimination because of their professional association with persons with disabilities.",

It might not be readily achievable for such a place of public accommodation to remove any existing barriers. If it is not readily achievable to remove existing architectural barriers, a public accommodation located in a private residence may meet its obligations under the Act and this part by providing its goods or services to clients or customers with disabilities through the use of alternative measures, including delivery of goods or services in the home of the customer or client, to the extent that such alternative measures are readily achievable (See Sec.36.305).

Paragraph (c) establishes the test to use in determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others. A public accommodation is required to make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical evidence or on the best available objective evidence, to determine: The nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will mitigate the risk. This is the test established by the Supreme Court in Arline. Such an inquiry is essential if the law is to achieve its goal of protecting disabled individuals from discrimination based on prejudice, stereotypes, or unfounded fear, while giving appropriate weight to legitimate concerns, such as the need to avoid exposing others to significant health and safety risks.

One suggested alternative was to permit public accommodations to exercise \"good faith'' judgment in determining whether an individual poses a direct threat, particularly when a public accommodation is dealing with a client or customer engaged in disorderly or disruptive behavior. The Department believes that the ADA clearly requires that any determination to exclude an individual from participation must be based on an objective standard. A public accommodation may establish neutral eligibility criteria as a condition of receiving its goods or services. As long as these criteria are necessary for the safe provision of the public accommodation's goods and services and applied neutrally to all clients or customers, regardless of whether they are individuals with disabilities, a person who is unable to meet the criteria may be excluded from participation without inquiry into the underlying reason for the inability to comply.",

It is common practice in schools and day care settings to exclude persons with such illnesses until the symptoms subside. The Department believes that these commenters misunderstand the scope of this rule. The ADA only prohibits discrimination against an individual with a disability. Under the ADA and this part, a \"disability'' is defined as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Common, short-term illnesses that predictably resolve themselves within a matter of days do not \"substantially limit'' a major life activity; therefore, it is not a violation of this part to exclude an individual from receiving the services of a public accommodation because of such transitory illness.

The Act and the regulation distinguish between illegal use of drugs and the legal use of substances, whether or not those substances are \"controlled substances,'' as defined in the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812). Some controlled substances are prescription drugs that have legitimate medical uses. Section 36.209 does not affect use of controlled substances pursuant to a valid prescription, under supervision by a licensed health care professional, or other use that is authorized by the Controlled Substances Act or any other provision of Federal law. It does apply to illegal use of those substances, as well as to illegal use of controlled substances that are not prescription drugs. The key question is whether the individual's use of the substance is illegal, not whether the substance has recognized legal uses.

Addiction is a disability, and addicts are individuals with disabilities protected by the Act. The protection, however, does not extend to actions based on the illegal use of the substance. In other words, an addict cannot use the fact of his or her addiction as a defense to an action based on illegal use of drugs. This distinction is not artificial. Congress intended to deny protection to people who engage in the illegal use of drugs, whether or not they are addicted, but to provide protection to addicts so long as they are not currently using drugs. A third distinction is the difficult one between current use and former use.

This paragraph does not authorize inquiries, tests, or other procedures that would disclose use of substances that are not controlled substances or are taken under supervision by a licensed health care professional, or other uses authorized by the Controlled Substances Act or other provisions of Federal law, because such uses are not included in the definition of \"illegal use of drugs. ''\nOne commenter argued that the rule should permit testing for lawful use of prescription drugs, but most favored the explanation that tests must be limited to unlawful use in order to avoid revealing the use of prescription medicine used to treat disabilities. Tests revealing legal use of prescription drugs might violate the prohibition in Sec.36.301 of attempts to unnecessarily identify the existence of a disability.",

Some commenters argued that Sec.36.210 does not go far enough, and that the regulation should prohibit smoking in all places of public accommodation. The reference to smoking in section 501 merely clarifies that the Act does not require public accommodations to accommodate smokers by permitting them to smoke in places of public accommodations. Section 36.211 Maintenance of Accessible Features\nSection 36.211 provides that a public accommodation shall maintain in operable working condition those features of facilities and equipment that are required to be readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities by the Act or this part. The Act requires that, to the maximum extent feasible, facilities must be accessible to, and usable by, individuals with disabilities. This section recognizes that it is not sufficient to provide features such as accessible routes, elevators, or ramps, if those features are not maintained in a manner that enables individuals with disabilities to use them. Inoperable elevators, locked accessible doors, or \"accessible'' routes that are obstructed by furniture, filing cabinets, or potted plants are neither \"accessible to'' nor \"usable by'' individuals with disabilities.",

Many commenters supported the requirements of Sec.36.212(c) in the proposed rule because it addressed an important reason for denial of services by public accommodations. One commenter argued that services could be denied if the insurance coverage required exclusion of people whose disabilities were reasonably related to the risks involved in that particular place of public accommodation. Sections 36.208 and 36.301 establish criteria for denial of participation on the basis of legitimate safety concerns. This paragraph does not prohibit consideration of such concerns in insurance policies, but provides that any exclusion on the basis of disability must be based on the permissible criteria, rather than on the terms of the insurance contract.

For example, a person who is blind may not be denied coverage based on blindness independent of actuarial risk classification.

Such a requirement would be beyond anything contemplated by the Act or by Congress and has therefore not been included in the Department's final rule. Because the legislative history of the ADA clarifies that different treatment of individuals with disabilities in insurance may be justified by sound actuarial data, such actuarial data will be critical to any potential litigation on this issue. This information would presumably be obtainable in a court proceeding where the insurer's actuarial data was the basis for different treatment of persons with disabilities. In addition, under some State regulatory schemes, insurers may have to file such actuarial information with the State regulatory agency and this information may be obtainable at the State level.

The rule does not require modifications to the legitimate areas of specialization of service providers. Section 36.302(b) provides that a public accommodation may refer an individual with a disability to another public accommodation, if that individual is seeking, or requires, treatment or services outside of the referring public accommodation's area of specialization, and if, in the normal course of its operations, the referring public accommodation would make a similar referral for an individual without a disability who seeks or requires the same treatment or services. For example, it would not be discriminatory for a physician who specializes only in burn treatment to refer an individual who is deaf to another physician for treatment of an injury other than a burn injury. To require a physician to accept patients outside of his or her specialty would fundamentally alter the nature of the medical practice and, therefore, not be required by this section.

It is not the Department's intention in Sec.36.302(b) to prohibit a physician from referring an individual with a disability to another physician, if the disability itself creates specialized complications for the patient's health that the physician lacks the experience or knowledge to address (see Education and Labor report at 106).

Similarly, a clothing boutique would not be required to have Brailled price tags if sales personnel provide price information orally upon request; and a bookstore would not be required to make available a sign language interpreter, because effective communication can be conducted by notepad. A critical determination is what constitutes an effective auxiliary aid or service. The Department's proposed rule recommended that, in determining what auxiliary aid to use, the public accommodation consult with an individual before providing him or her with a particular auxiliary aid or service.

To the contrary, the legislative history demonstrates congressional intent to strongly encourage consulting with persons with disabilities. In its analysis of the ADA's auxiliary aids requirement for public accommodations, the House Education and Labor Committee stated that it \"expects'' that \"public accommodation(s) will consult with the individual with a disability before providing a particular auxiliary aid or service'' (Education and Labor report at 107).

It is not difficult to imagine a wide range of communications involving areas such as health, legal matters, and finances that would be sufficiently lengthy or complex to require an interpreter for effective communication. In some situations, an effective alternative to use of a notepad or an interpreter may be the use of a computer terminal upon which the representative of the public accommodation and the customer or client can exchange typewritten messages. Section 36.303(d) specifically addresses requirements for TDD's. Partly because of the availability of telecommunications relay services to be established under title IV of the ADA, Sec.36.303(d)(2) provides that a public accommodation is not required to use a telecommunication device for the deaf (TDD) in receiving or making telephone calls incident to its operations.

Classes of Sleeping Accommodations\nIn addition to the communications barriers posed by permanent signage and alarm systems noted by Congress (see Education and Labor report at 110), the Department would also include among the communications barriers covered by Sec.36.304 the failure to provide adequate sound buffers, and the presence of physical partitions that hamper the passage of sound waves between employees and customers. Given that Sec.36.304's proper focus is on the removal of physical barriers, the Department believes that the obligation to provide communications equipment and devices such as TDD's, telephone handset amplifiers, assistive listening devices, and digital check-out displays is more appropriately determined by the requirements for auxiliary aids and services under Sec.36.303 (see Education and Labor report at 107 - 108). The obligation to remove communications barriers that are structural in nature under Sec.36.304, of course, is independent of any obligation to provide auxiliary aids and services under Sec.36.303. The statutory provision also requires the readily achievable removal of certain barriers in existing vehicles and rail passenger cars.

In striking a balance between guaranteeing access to individuals with disabilities and recognizing the legitimate cost concerns of businesses and other private entities, the ADA establishes different standards for existing facilities and new construction. In existing facilities, which are the subject of Sec.36.304, where retrofitting may prove costly, a less rigorous degree of accessibility is required than in the case of new construction and alterations (see Sec..36.401 - 36.406) where accessibility can be more conveniently and economically incorporated in the initial stages of design and construction. For example, a bank with existing automatic teller machines (ATM's) would have to remove barriers to the use of the ATM's, if it is readily achievable to do so. Whether or not it is necessary to take actions such as ramping a few steps or raising or lowering an ATM would be determined by whether the actions can be accomplished easily and without much difficulty or expense. On the other hand, a newly constructed bank with ATM's would be required by Sec.36.401 to have an ATM that is \"readily accessible to and usable by'' persons with disabilities in accordance with accessibility guidelines incorporated under Sec.36.406.

For example, Sec.36.304 requires the removal, when readily achievable, of barriers caused by the location of temporary or movable structures, such as furniture, equipment, and display racks. In order to provide access to individuals who use wheelchairs, for example, restaurants may need to rearrange tables and chairs, and department stores may need to reconfigure display racks and shelves. As stated in Sec.36.304(f), such actions are not readily achievable to the extent that they would result in a significant loss of selling or serving space. If the widening of all aisles in selling or serving areas is not readily achievable, then selected widening should be undertaken to maximize the amount of merchandise or the number of tables accessible to individuals who use wheelchairs. Access to goods and services provided in any remaining inaccessible areas must be made available through alternative methods to barrier removal, as required by Sec.36.305. Because the purpose of title III of the ADA is to ensure that public accommodations are accessible to their customers, clients, or patrons (as opposed to their employees, who are the focus of title I), the obligation to remove barriers under Sec.36.304 does not extend to areas of a facility that are used exclusively as employee work areas.",

The list includes examples of measures, such as adding raised letter markings on elevator control buttons and installing flashing alarm lights, that would be used to remove communications barriers that are structural in nature. It is not an exhaustive list, but merely an illustrative one. Moreover, the inclusion of a measure on this list does not mean that it is readily achievable in all cases. Whether or not any of these measures is readily achievable is to be determined on a case-by-case basis in light of the particular circumstances presented and the factors listed in the definition of readily achievable (Sec.36.104). A public accommodation generally would not be required to remove a barrier to physical access posed by a flight of steps, if removal would require extensive ramping or an elevator. Ramping a single step, however, will likely be readily achievable, and ramping several steps will in many circumstances also be readily achievable. The readily achievable standard does not require barrier removal that requires extensive restructuring or burdensome expense. Thus, where it is not readily achievable to do, the ADA would not require a restaurant to provide access to a restroom reachable only by a flight of stairs.",

The readily achievable defense requires a less demanding level of exertion by a public accommodation than does the undue burden defense to the auxiliary aids requirements of Sec.36.303. In that sense, it can be characterized as a \"lower'' standard than the undue burden standard. The readily achievable defense is also less demanding than the undue hardship defense in section 102(b)(5) of the ADA, which limits the obligation to make reasonable accommodation in employment. Barrier removal measures that are not easily accomplishable and are not able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense are not required under the readily achievable standard, even if they do not impose an undue burden or an undue hardship.

Although the obligation to engage in readily achievable barrier removal is clearly a continuing duty, the Department has declined to establish any independent requirement for an annual assessment or self-evaluation. It is best left to the public accommodations subject to Sec.36.304 to establish policies to assess compliance that are appropriate to the particular circumstances faced by the wide range of public accommodations covered by the ADA. However, even in the absence of an explicit regulatory requirement for periodic self-evaluations, the Department still urges public accommodations to establish procedures for an ongoing assessment of their compliance with the ADA's barrier removal requirements. The Department recommends that this process include appropriate consultation with individuals with disabilities or organizations representing them.

Such a plan, if appropriately designed and diligently executed, could serve as evidence of a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of Sec.36.104. In developing an implementation plan for readily achievable barrier removal, a public accommodation should consult with local organizations representing persons with disabilities and solicit their suggestions for cost-effective means of making individual places of public accommodation accessible. Such organizations may also be helpful in allocating scarce resources and establishing priorities.

Because the resources available for barrier removal may not be adequate to remove all existing barriers at any given time, Sec.36.304(c) suggests priorities for determining which types of barriers should be mitigated or eliminated first. The purpose of these priorities is to facilitate long-term business planning and to maximize, in light of limited resources, the degree of effective access that will result from any given level of expenditure. Although many commenters expressed support for the concept of establishing priorities, a significant number objected to their mandatory nature in the proposed rule.

Section 36.307 Accessible or Special Goods. Section 36.307 establishes that the rule does not require a public accommodation to alter its inventory to include accessible or special goods with accessibility features that are designed for, or facilitate use by, individuals with disabilities. As specified in Sec.36.307(c), accessible or special goods include such items as Brailled versions of books, books on audio-cassettes, closed captioned video tapes, special sizes or lines of clothing, and special foods to meet particular dietary needs. The purpose of the ADA's public accommodations requirements is to ensure accessibility to the goods offered by a public accommodation, not to alter the nature or mix of goods that the public accommodation has typically provided. In other words, a bookstore, for example, must make its facilities and sales operations accessible to individuals with disabilities, but is not required to stock Brailled or large print books.",

Although a public accommodation is not required by Sec.36.307(a) to modify its inventory, it is required by Sec.36.307(b), at the request of an individual with disabilities, to order accessible or special goods that it does not customarily maintain in stock if, in the normal course of its operation, it makes special orders for unstocked goods, and if the accessible or special goods can be obtained from a supplier with whom the public accommodation customarily does business. For example, a clothing store would be required to order specially-sized clothing at the request of an individual with a disability, if it customarily makes special orders for clothing that it does not keep in stock, and if the clothing can be obtained from one of the store's customary suppliers.

Section 36.308 Seating in Assembly Areas. Section 36.308 establishes specific requirements for removing barriers to physical access in assembly areas, which include such facilities as theaters, concert halls, auditoriums, lecture halls, and conference rooms. This section does not address the provision of auxiliary aids or the removal of communications barriers that are structural in nature. These communications requirements are the focus of other provisions of the regulation (see Sec..36.303 - 36.304). Individuals who use wheelchairs historically have been relegated to inferior seating in the back of assembly areas separate from accompanying family members and friends. The provisions of Sec.36.308 are intended to promote integration and equality in seating.

The final rule specifies that portable chairs or other means to permit family members or companions to sit with individuals who use wheelchairs must be provided only when it is readily achievable to do so. In order to facilitate seating of wheelchair users who wish to transfer to existing seating, paragraph (a)(1) of the final rule adds a requirement that, to the extent readily achievable, a reasonable number of seats with removable aisle-side armrests must be provided. Many persons in wheelchairs are able to transfer to existing seating with this relatively minor modification. This solution avoids the potential safety hazard created by the use of portable chairs and fosters integration.

For example, Sec.4.33 of ADAAG only requires wheelchair spaces to be provided in more than one location when the seating capacity of the assembly area exceeds 300. Therefore, paragraph (a) of Sec.36.308 may not be interpreted to require readily achievable dispersal of wheelchair seating in assembly areas with 300 or fewer seats.

The Department, therefore, included it in the paragraphs of Sec.36.309 requiring the provision of auxiliary aids. One commenter argued that similar limitations should apply to all of the requirements of Sec.36.309, but the Department did not consider this extension appropriate. Commenters who objected to permitting \"alternative accessible arrangements'' argued that such arrangements allow segregation and should not be permitted, unless they are the least restrictive available alternative, for example, for someone who cannot leave home.

Employees should have the same types of access, although those individuals require access to and around the employment area as well as to the area in which goods and services are provided. The ADA is geared to the future -- its goal being that, over time, access will be the rule, rather than the exception. Thus, the Act only requires modest expenditures, of the type addressed in Sec.36.304 of this part, to provide access to existing facilities not otherwise being altered, but requires all new construction and alterations to be accessible. The Act does not require new construction or alterations; it simply requires that, when a public accommodation or other private entity undertakes the construction or alteration of a facility subject to the Act, the newly constructed or altered facility must be made accessible. This subpart establishes the requirements for new construction and alterations. As explained under the discussion of the definition of \"facility,'' Sec.36.104, pending development of specific requirements, the Department will not apply this subpart to places of public accommodation located in mobile units, boats, or other conveyances.",

Section 303 (a)(1) of the Act provides that discrimination for purposes of section 302(a) of the Act includes a failure to design and construct facilities for first occupancy later than 30 months after the date of enactment (i.e., after January 26, 1993) that are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. Paragraph 36.401(a)(1) restates the general requirement for accessible new construction. The proposed rule stated that \"any public accommodation or other private entity responsible for design and construction'' must ensure that facilities conform to this requirement. Various commenters suggested that the proposed language was not consistent with the statute because it substituted \"private entity responsible for design and construction'' for the statutory language; because it did not address liability on the part of architects, contractors, developers, tenants, owners, and other entities; and because it limited the liability of entities responsible for commercial facilities. In response, the Department has revised this paragraph to repeat the language of section 303(a) of the ADA. The Department will interpret this section in a manner consistent with the intent of the statute and with the nature of the responsibilities of the various entities for design, for construction, or for both.",

The proposed rule set forth for comment two alternative ways by which to determine what facilities are subject to the Act and what standards apply. Paragraph (a)(2) of the final rule is a slight variation on Option One in the proposed rule. The reasons for the Department's choice of Option One are discussed later in this section. Paragraph (a)(2) acknowledges that Congress did not contemplate having actual occupancy be the sole trigger for the accessibility requirements, because the statute prohibits a failure to \"design and construct for first occupancy,'' rather than requiring accessibility in facilities actually occupied after a particular date. The commenters overwhelmingly agreed with the Department's proposal to use a date certain; many cited the reasons given in the preamble to the proposed rule.

To redesign or reconstruct portions of a facility if it begins to appear that occupancy will be later than anticipated would be quite costly. A fixed date also assists those responsible for enforcing, or monitoring compliance with, the statute, and those protected by it. The Department considered using as a trigger date for application of the accessibility standards the date on which a permit is granted. The Department chose instead the date on which a complete permit application is certified as received by the appropriate government entity. Almost all commenters agreed with this choice of a trigger date. This decision is based partly on information that several months or even years can pass between application for a permit and receipt of a permit. Design is virtually complete at the time an application is complete (i.e., certified to contain all the information required by the State, county, or local government).",

Classes of Sleeping Accommodations\nAfter an application is filed, delays may occur before the permit is granted due to numerous factors (not necessarily relating to accessibility): for example, hazardous waste discovered on the property, flood plain requirements, zoning disputes, or opposition to the project from various groups. These factors should not require redesign for accessibility if the application was completed before January 26, 1992. However, if the facility must be redesigned for other reasons, such as a change in density or environmental preservation, and the final permit is based on a new application, the rule would require accessibility if that application was certified complete after January 26, 1992. The certification of receipt of a complete application for a building permit is an appropriate point in the process because certifications are issued in writing by governmental authorities. In addition, this approach presents a clear and objective standard. However, a few commenters pointed out that in some jurisdictions it is not possible to receive a \"certification'' that an application is complete, and suggested that in those cases the fixed date should be the date on which an application for a permit is received by the government agency.

Numerous commenters said that time frames for designing and constructing some types of facilities (for example, health care facilities) can range from two to four years or more. They expressed concerns that Option Two, which would apply to some facilities already under design or construction as of the date the Act was signed, and to some on which construction began shortly after enactment, could result in costly redesign or reconstruction of those facilities.

Numerous commenters characterized Option Two as having no support in the statute and Option One as being more consistent with congressional intent. Those who favored Option Two pointed out that it would include more facilities within the coverage of the new construction standards. They argued that because similar accessibility requirements are in effect under State laws, no hardship would be imposed by this option.

To the extent that a particular type or element of a facility is not specifically addressed by the standards, the language of this section is the safest guide. A private entity that renders an \"accessible'' building inaccessible in its operation, through policies or practices, may be in violation of section 302 of the Act. For example, a private entity can render an entrance to a facility inaccessible by keeping an accessible entrance open only during certain hours (whereas the facility is available to others for a greater length of time). A facility could similarly be rendered inaccessible if a person with disabilities is significantly limited in her or his choice of a range of accommodations. Ensuring access to a newly constructed facility will include providing access to the facility from the street or parking lot, to the extent the responsible entity has control over the route from those locations. In some cases, the private entity will have no control over access at the point where streets, curbs, or sidewalks already exist, and in those instances the entity is encouraged to request modifications to a sidewalk, including installation of curb cuts, from a public entity responsible for them.",

Such limitations for topographical problems are analogous to an acknowledged limitation in the application of the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) of 1988. Almost all commenters supported this interpretation. Two commenters argued that the DOJ requirement is too limiting and would not exempt some buildings that should be exempted because of soil conditions, terrain, and other unusual site conditions. These commenters suggested consistency with HUD's Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines (56 FR 9472 (1991)), which generally would allow exceptions from accessibility requirements, or allow compliance with less stringent requirements, on sites with slopes exceeding 10%. The Department is aware of the provisions in HUD's guidelines, which were issued on March 6, 1991, after passage of the ADA and publication of the Department's proposed rule.",

The Department has included in the final rule the substance of the proposed provision, which is faithful to the intent of the statute, as expressed in the legislative history. (See Senate report at 70 - 71; Education and Labor report at 120.)\nThe limited structural impracticability exception means that it is acceptable to deviate from accessibility requirements only where unique characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility features and where providing accessibility would destroy the physical integrity of a facility. A situation in which a building must be built on stilts because of its location in marshlands or over water is an example of one of the few situations in which the exception for structural impracticability would apply. This exception to accessibility requirements should not be applied to situations in which a facility is located in \"hilly'' terrain or on a plot of land upon which there are steep grades. In such circumstances, accessibility can be achieved without destroying the physical integrity of a structure, and is required in the construction of new facilities.",

Guidance on this question is provided in the discussion of the definitions of place of public accommodation and commercial facility. With respect to the structural impracticability exception, a mixed-use facility could not take advantage of the Fair Housing exemption, to the extent that it is less stringent than the ADA exemption, except for those portions of the facility that are subject only to the Fair Housing Act. As explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, in those rare circumstances in which it is structurally impracticable to achieve full compliance with accessibility retirements under the ADA, places of public accommodation and commercial facilities should still be designed and constructed to incorporate accessibility features to the extent that the features are structurally practicable. The accessibility requirements should not be viewed as an all-or-nothing proposition in such circumstances.

For example, a facility that is of necessity built on stilts and cannot be made accessible to persons who use wheelchairs because it is structurally impracticable to do so, must be made accessible for individuals with vision or hearing impairments or other kinds of disabilities. Elevator Exemption\nSection 36.401(d) implements the \"elevator exemption'' for new construction in section 303(b) of the ADA. The elevator exemption is an exception to the general requirement that new facilities be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. Generally, an elevator is the most common way to provide individuals who use wheelchairs \"ready access'' to floor levels above or below the ground floor of a multi-story building. Congress, however, chose not to require elevators in new small buildings, that is, those with less than three stories or less than 3,000 square feet per story.",

For example, a new office building that will have only two stories, with no elevator planned, will not be required to have an elevator, even if each story has 20,000 square feet. In other words, having either less than 3000 square feet per story or less than three stories qualifies a facility for the exemption; it need not qualify for the exemption on both counts. Similarly, a facility that has five stories of 2800 square feet each qualifies for the exemption. If a facility has three or more stories at any point, it is not eligible for the elevator exemption unless all the stories are less than 3000 square feet.

The Department agrees that this design choice should not negate the elevator requirement for new construction. Some business groups answered the question in the affirmative, and some suggested a different definition of shopping center. For example, one commenter recommended the addition of a requirement that the five or more establishments be physically connected on the non-ground floors by a common pedestrian walkway or pathway, because otherwise a series of stand-alone facilities would have to comply with the elevator requirement, which would be unduly burdensome and perhaps infeasible. Another suggested use of what it characterized as the standard industry definition: \"A group of retail stores and related business facilities, the whole planned, developed, operated and managed as a unit.

Some commenters suggested that access to restrooms and other shared facilities open to the public should be required even if those facilities were not on a shopping floor. Such a provision with respect to toilet or bathing facilities is included in the elevator exception in final ADAAG 4.1.3(5).

Any facility housing five or more of the types of sales or rental establishments described, regardless of the number of other types of places of public accommodation housed there (e.g., offices, movie theatres, restaurants), is a shopping center or shopping mall.

This requirement applies to buildings that do not house sales or rental establishments or the professional offices of a health care provider as well as to those in which such establishments or offices are all located on the ground floor. In such a situation, little added cost is entailed in making the second floor accessible, because it is similar in structure and floor plan to the ground floor. There are several reasons for this provision. First, some individuals who are mobility impaired may work on a building's second floor, which they can reach by stairs and the use of crutches; however, the same individuals, once they reach the second floor, may then use a wheelchair that is kept in the office. Secondly, because the first floor will be accessible, there will be little additional cost entailed in making the second floor, with the same structure and generally the same floor plan, accessible.

This point is specifically addressed in the appendix to ADAAG (Sec.4.1.3(5)). ADAAG also addresses in detail the situations in which lifts are permitted or required. Section 36.402 Alterations\nSections 36.402 - 36.405 implement section 303(a)(2) of the Act, which requires that alterations to existing facilities be made in a way that ensures that the altered portion is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. This part does not require alterations; it simply provides that when alterations are undertaken, they must be made in a manner that provides access.",

Therefore, Congress provided, in section 303(a)(2) of the Act, that alterations to the path of travel that are disproportionate in cost and scope to the overall alteration are not required. The Act requires the Attorney General to determine at what point the cost of providing an accessible path of travel becomes disproportionate. The proposed rule provided three options for making this determination. Two committees of Congress specifically addressed this issue: the House Committee on Education and Labor and the House Committee on the Judiciary. The reports issued by each committee suggested that accessibility alterations to a path of travel might be \"disproportionate'' if they exceed 30% of the alteration costs (Education and Labor report at 113; Judiciary report at 64).

Paragraph (h) (paragraph (g) in the proposed rule) provides that the obligation to provide an accessible path of travel may not be evaded by performing a series of small alterations to the area served by a single path of travel if those alterations could have been performed as a single undertaking. If an area containing a primary function has been altered without providing an accessible path of travel to serve that area, and subsequent alterations of that area, or a different area on the same path of travel, are undertaken within three years of the original alteration, the total cost of alterations to primary function areas on that path of travel during the preceding three year period shall be considered in determining whether the cost of making the path of travel serving that area accessible is disproportionate.",

Section 36.404 Alterations: Elevator Exemption\nSection 36.404 implements the elevator exemption in section 303(b) of the Act as it applies to altered facilities. The provisions of section 303(b) are discussed in the preamble to Sec.36.401(d) above. The statute applies the same exemption to both new construction and alterations. The principal difference between the requirements of Sec.36.401(d) and Sec.36.404 is that, in altering an existing facility that is not eligible for the statutory exemption, the public accommodation or other private entity responsible for the alteration is not required to install an elevator if the installation of an elevator would be disproportionate in cost and scope to the cost of the overall alteration as provided in Sec.36.403(f)(1). In addition, the standards referenced in Sec.36.406 (ADAAG) provide that installation of an elevator in an altered facility is not required if it is \"technically infeasible.

It has been brought to the attention of the Department that there is some misunderstanding about the scope of the elevator exemption as it applies to the professional office of a health care provider. A public accommodation, such as the professional office of a health care provider, is required to remove architectural barriers to its facility to the extent that such barrier removal is readily achievable (see Sec.36.304), but it is not otherwise required by this part to undertake new construction or alterations. This part does not require that an existing two story building that houses the professional office of a health care provider be altered for the purpose of providing elevator access. If, however, alterations to the area housing the office of the health care provider are undertaken for other purposes, the installation of an elevator might be required, but only if the cost of the elevator is not disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration. Neither the Act nor this part prohibits a health care provider from locating his or her professional office in an existing facility that does not have an elevator.",

Classes of Sleeping Accommodations\nBecause of the unique challenges presented in altering existing facilities, the Department has adopted a definition of \"shopping center or shopping mall'' for the purposes of this section that is slightly different from the definition adopted under Sec.36.401(d). For the purposes of this section, a \"shopping center or shopping mall'' is (1) a building housing five or more sales or rental establishments, or (2) a series of buildings on a common site, connected by a common pedestrian access route above or below the ground floor, either under common ownership or common control or developed either as one project or as a series of related projects, housing five or more sales or rental establishments. As is the case with new construction, the term \"shopping center or shopping mall'' only includes floor levels housing at least one sales or rental establishment, or any floor level that was designed or intended for use by at least one sales or rental establishment. The Department believes that it is appropriate to use a different definition of \"shopping center or shopping mall'' for this section than for Sec.36.401, in order to make it clear that a series of existing buildings on a common site that is altered for the use of sales or rental establishments does not become a \"shopping center or shopping mall'' required to install an elevator, unless there is a common means of pedestrian access above or below the ground floor.",

The Department believes, however, that the criteria of adverse effect employed under the National Historic Preservation Act are inappropriate for this rule because section 504(c) of the ADA specifies that special alterations provisions shall apply only when an alteration would \"threaten or destroy the historic significance of qualified historic buildings and facilities.",

Section 4.1.1, Application, provides that all areas of newly designed or newly constructed buildings and facilities and altered portions of existing buildings and facilities required to be accessible by Sec.4.1.6 must comply with the guidelines unless otherwise provided in Sec.4.1.1 or a special application section. It addresses areas used only by employees as work areas, temporary structures, and general exceptions. Section 4.1.1(3) preserves the basic principle of the proposed rule: Areas that may be used by employees with disabilities shall be designed and constructed so that an individual with a disability can approach, enter, and exit the area. The language has been clarified to provide that it applies to any area used only as a work area (not just to areas \"that may be used by employees with disabilities''), and that the guidelines do not require that any area used as an individual work station be designed with maneuvering space or equipped to be accessible.",

Three significant changes, further explained below, were made from the proposed subpart, in response to comments. First, the State or local jurisdiction is required to hold a public hearing on its proposed request for certification and to submit to the Department, as part of the information and materials in support of a request for certification, a transcript of the hearing. Second, the time allowed for interested persons and organizations to comment on the request filed with the Department (Sec.36.605(a)(1)) has been changed from 30 to 60 days. Finally, a new Sec.36.608, Guidance concerning model codes, has been added. Section 36.601 establishes the definitions to be used for purposes of this subpart. Two of the definitions have been modified, and a definition of \"model code'' has been added. First, in response to a comment, a reference to a code \"or part thereof'' has been added to the definition of \"code. '' The purpose of this addition is to clarify that an entire code need not be submitted if only part of it is relevant to accessibility, or if the jurisdiction seeks certification of only some of the portions that concern accessibility.

Second, the definition of \"submitting official'' has been modified. The proposed rule defined the submitting official to be the State or local official who has principal responsibility for administration of a code. Commenters pointed out that in some cases more than one code within the same jurisdiction is relevant for purposes of certification. It was also suggested that the Department allow a State to submit a single application on behalf of the State, as well as on behalf of any local jurisdictions required to follow the State accessibility requirements. Consistent with these comments, the Department has added to the definition language clarifying that the official can be one authorized to submit a code on behalf of a jurisdiction.

Some urged that certification not be allowed in jurisdictions where waivers can be granted, unless there is a clearly identified decision-making process, with written rulings and notice to affected parties of any waiver or modification request. One commenter urged establishment of a dispute resolution mechanism, providing for interpretation (usually through a building official) and an administrative appeals mechanism (generally called Boards of Appeal, Boards of Construction Appeals, or Boards of Review), before certification could be granted. The Department thoroughly considered these proposals but has declined to provide for certification of processes of enforcement or administration of State and local codes.

ADAAG includes in Sec.2.2 a statement allowing departures from particular requirements where substantially equivalent or greater access and usability is provided. Several sections specifically allow for alternative methods providing equivalent facilitation and, in some cases, provide examples. (See, e.g., section 4.31.9, Text Telephones; section 7.2(2) (iii), Sales and Service Counters.)
